## Pirate 16

### Preamble

    The Pirate 16 Game Jam theme is “You Are The Weapon” and now we are the gods.

### Colors 

    Main Green - `#00bf63`
    Main Brown - `#916a4f`

#### UIUX

    Mock Buttons - [Rock Buttons From void1gaming](https://void1gaming.itch.io/pixel-buttons-2-rock-buttons)

### Assets

    We will be using the [Corgi Engine with Unity](https://kbve.com/application/unity/#corgi).

    For the base UI assets, we will grab some examples from [Itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-unity/tag-user-interface).

    Trees were added from [Stylized Nature Mega Kit](https://quaternius.itch.io/stylized-nature-megakit)
    
    Note: We removed this -> Now going to try and add the [Ultimate Platformer Pack](https://quaternius.itch.io/ultimate-platformer-pack)

#### Background

    End of the Game Portal from [the Gateway](https://painartio.itch.io/the-gateway).
    Might as well grab some kenny assets, the first will be the [survival kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/survival-kit)

### Dev

    The Dev cycle of webgl and unity is always a pain!
    There are still some issues with the auto graphics that I will have to resolve on the macbook.
