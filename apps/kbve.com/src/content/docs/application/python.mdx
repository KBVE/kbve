## pip

-   `pip` is the package manager for Python. It is used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

`pip` is included with most Python distributions, and it can be installed separately for other distributions.

To use `pip`, you need to know the name of the package you want to install.
You can find the name of the package by searching the Python Package Index (PyPI).

Once you know the name of the package, you can install it with the following command:

```shell
pip install <$package_name>
```

Replacing the syntax of `<$package_name>` with the package you would like to install from the PyPI libraries.

In this example, we will look into the install of the `requests` package via `pip`.

```shell
pip install requests
```

Offering high performance, FastAPI leverages asynchronous programming to achieve speeds comparable to those of Node.js and Go, making it ideal for developing scalable and efficient web applications.
The framework is built on top of Starlette for handling web components and Pydantic for data validation and serialization, ensuring smooth data management.
FastAPI stands out for its automatic interactive API documentation, featuring Swagger UI and ReDoc, which simplifies the process of exploring and testing API endpoints.
The framework also supports OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens, making it a robust choice for secure API development.
Additionally, FastAPI's design focuses on developer productivity, reducing code duplication and enhancing maintainability.
By providing built-in support for data validation, serialization, and interactive documentation, FastAPI accelerates the development process, making it a popular choice for both small projects and large-scale enterprise applications.

### Tutorial on Setting Up FastAPI

<Steps>

0.  **Prepare Dev Environment**:

    Ensure that Python 3.7 or later is installed on your system.
    You can download the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
    Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

    ```sh
    python --version
    ```

    This should display the installed Python version.

    Creating a virtual environment is a good practice to manage project dependencies.
    In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    ```

    This command creates a virtual environment named `env`. Activate the virtual environment by running:

        - On Windows:

        ```sh
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```

        - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

1.  **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**:

    FastAPI requires an ASGI server to run. Uvicorn is a recommended ASGI server for FastAPI. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn within your virtual environment by running:

    ```sh
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

    This command installs both FastAPI and Uvicorn, enabling you to build and serve your API.

2.  **Create a Basic FastAPI Application**:

    Organize your project directory with a simple file tree structure to keep everything neat and manageable.

    <FileTree>

    -   my_fastapi_project/
        -   main.py
        -   requirements.txt
    -   .gitignore

    </FileTree>

    -   **main.py:** The main application file where the FastAPI app is defined.
    -   **requirements.txt:** A file to list project dependencies, including `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.
    -   **.gitignore:** A file to specify which files and directories to ignore in version control (optional, but recommended).

    Create a new Python file in your project directory, for example, `main.py`.
    Open this file in a text editor and add the following code:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    async def read_root():
        return {"Hello": "World"}

    @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
    async def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
        return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
    ```

    This code defines a basic FastAPI application with two endpoints: a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a simple greeting and an endpoint (`/items/{item_id}`) that returns an item ID and an optional query parameter.

3.  **Run the FastAPI Application**:

    Use Uvicorn to run your FastAPI application. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```shell
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The `--reload` option enables automatic reloads when code changes are detected, which is useful for development.
    Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the greeting message.
    Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/1?q=test` to see the item endpoint in action.

4.  **Explore Automatic Interactive API Documentation**:

    FastAPI provides interactive API documentation automatically.
    With your application running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to see the Swagger UI.
    This interface allows you to interact with your API endpoints directly from the browser.
    Another documentation interface is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`.

5.  **Add More Functionality**:

    Expand your FastAPI application by adding more routes, handling different HTTP methods, and integrating data validation.
    FastAPI’s documentation provides detailed guidance on various features, including path parameters, query parameters, request bodies, and response models.

    Let us begin by installing `Pydantic`, here is a quick command to do so:

    ```shell
    pip install pydantic
    ```

    Next, to add a POST endpoint for creating items, modify `main.py`:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    app = FastAPI()

    class Item(BaseModel):
        name: str
        price: float
        is_offer: bool = None

    @app.post("/items/")
    async def create_item(item: Item):
        return item
    ```

    This code defines an `Item` model using Pydantic and a POST endpoint that accepts an `Item` and returns it.

    By following these steps, you will have a fully functional FastAPI application ready for further development and customization.

</Steps>

## Pydantic

Pydantic is a powerful data validation and settings management library for Python, leveraging Python type annotations to ensure robust and reliable data handling.
By defining data models through type hints, Pydantic automates the validation and parsing process, converting input data into the appropriate types and structures.
This functionality is particularly beneficial in scenarios requiring strict data integrity, such as API development and configuration management.
Pydantic supports various standard library types, custom data types, and even complex nested data structures.

Built with performance in mind, Pydantic's core validation logic is implemented in Rust, making it one of the fastest data validation libraries available.
The library also includes features like JSON Schema generation, custom validators, and the ability to run in strict or lax modes, allowing for flexible data coercion and validation.
With broad adoption, including use by major companies and integration with popular frameworks like FastAPI, Pydantic has become a cornerstone in the Python ecosystem for data validation.

    - pydantic_project/
        - venv/
        - main.py
        - models/
            - user.py
        - utils/
            - helpers.py
    - .gitignore
    - README.md
    </FileTree>

2.  **Create Pydantic Models**:
        
    Create a Pydantic model in `models/user.py`.

    ```python
    # models/user.py
    from pydantic import BaseModel, EmailStr, Field
    from typing import List, Optional
    from datetime import date

    class Address(BaseModel):
        street: str
        city: str
        state: str
        zip_code: str

    class User(BaseModel):
        id: int
        name: str = Field(..., max_length=100)
        email: EmailStr
        is_active: bool = True
        addresses: List[Address] = []
        date_of_birth: Optional[date] = None

        class Config:
            schema_extra = {
                "example": {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
                    "is_active": True,
                    "addresses": [
                        {
                            "street": "123 Main St",
                            "city": "Anytown",
                            "state": "CA",
                            "zip_code": "12345"
                        }
                    ],
                    "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01"
                }
            }
    ```

3.  **Create Helper Functions**:

    Create helper functions in `utils/helpers.py`.

    ```python
    # utils/helpers.py
    from models.user import User, Address
    from typing import List

    def create_user(data: dict) -> User:
        return User(**data)

    def filter_active_users(users: List[User]) -> List[User]:
        return [user for user in users if user.is_active]

    def add_address_to_user(user: User, address_data: dict) -> User:
        address = Address(**address_data)
        user.addresses.append(address)
        return user
    ```

4.  **Main Application Logic**:

    Create the main application logic in `main.py`.
        
    ```python
    # main.py
    from models.user import User
    from utils.helpers import create_user, filter_active_users, add_address_to_user

    # Sample user data
    user_data = {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@example.com",
        "is_active": True,
        "addresses": [
            {
                "street": "123 Main St",
                "city": "Anytown",
                "state": "CA",
                "zip_code": "12345"
            }
        ],
        "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01"
    }

    # Create a user
    user = create_user(user_data)
    print(user)

    # Add a new address to the user
    new_address = {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Othertown",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip_code": "67890"
    }
    user = add_address_to_user(user, new_address)
    print(user)

    # Filter active users
    users = [user, create_user({**user_data, "id": 2, "is_active": False})]
    active_users = filter_active_users(users)
    print(active_users)
    ```

5.  **Run Your Application**:

    Run your application using the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

6.  **Extending Valdiation**:

    Pydantic automatically validates data. For instance, if you try to create a user with an invalid email, it will raise a `ValidationError`.

    **Custom Validators**
    You can add custom validation methods within your model.

    ```python
    from pydantic import validator

    class User(BaseModel):
        # ... (other fields)

        @validator('name')
        def name_must_be_capitalized(cls, v):
            if not v.istitle():
                raise ValueError('Name must be capitalized')
            return v
    ```

    **Serialization and Deserialization**
    Pydantic models can easily be serialized to and deserialized from JSON.

    ```python
    user_json = user.json()
    new_user = User.parse_raw(user_json)
    ```

    **Schema Generation**
    Pydantic can generate JSON Schemas for your models.

    ```python
    print(User.schema_json(indent=2))
    ```

</Steps>

You now have a detailed setup for a Pydantic project with models, helper functions, and application logic.
Do not forget, you can extend this project further by adding more models, complex validation, and integrating with other parts of your application.
