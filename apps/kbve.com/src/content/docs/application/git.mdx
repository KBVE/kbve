## Information

Git, a powerful distributed version control system, excels in managing project history and facilitating collaboration among multiple developers.
By efficiently tracking changes in source code, Git enables seamless coordination and conflict resolution, ensuring that every contribution is accounted for.
Boasting lightning-fast performance and robust branching capabilities, Git supports a wide range of workflows, from individual development to large-scale enterprise projects.
Renowned for its flexibility and reliability, Git has become an indispensable tool in modern software development, empowering teams to innovate and iterate with confidence.

<Aside>
  Git commands can be powerful and sometimes destructive. Always make sure you
  understand the implications of a command before running it, especially those
  that alter history, such as **git reset**, **git rebase**, and **git
  filter-branch**. It's often a good idea to create backups or work on a
  separate branch when experimenting with these commands.

## Github

GitHub, a leading platform for version control and collaboration, leverages Git to provide a seamless environment for developers to host, review, and manage code.
Offering features like pull requests, code reviews, and integrated issue tracking, GitHub streamlines the development workflow and fosters collaboration among team members.
With its robust community and extensive ecosystem of tools and integrations, GitHub enhances productivity and innovation, making it an essential resource for both open-source projects and private repositories.
Additionally, GitHub's user-friendly interface and powerful features make it a popular choice for developers seeking to share their work and contribute to the global coding community.

### Github Actions

GitHub Actions are YAML files designed to automate repetitive tasks using predefined workflows and variables, enabling seamless integration and continuous deployment.
They enhance productivity by managing build, test, and deployment processes directly within the GitHub environment.

#### KBVE API GROQ

These are the custom notes on our github actions!

#### ci-patch.yml

The `ci-patch.yml` GitHub Action is designed to automate the process of creating pull requests for branches that follow a naming pattern starting with "patch".
When a push event occurs on any of these branches, the action triggers and runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
It first checks out the code using the `actions/checkout` action. Then, it uses the `diillson/auto-pull-request` action to automatically create a pull request from the patch branch to the `dev` branch.
The pull request will have a title indicating the source branch and a body containing the message "An automated PR".
Additionally, the pull request will be labeled with "auto-pr".

```yaml
name: CI Patch

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'patch*'

jobs:
  handle:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Auto-Pull
        uses: diillson/auto-pull-request@latest
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          destination_branch: 'dev'
          pr_title: 'Pulling ${{ github.ref }} into Dev'
          pr_body: |
            *An automated PR*
          pr_label: 'auto-pr'
```

### kbve-shell

Example of calling the KBVE Shell

```yaml
- name: React Fish & Chip
  if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
  uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
  with:
    flag: '-build react-phaser-fish-chip'
    create_pull_request: true
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    pull_request_title: 'react-fish-chip-built-request'
    pull_request_body: 'React Fish and Chip Built Request'
```

#### Music

These are brief notes on the `i-music-process.yml` within our monorepo.

These two steps are the core for the action that would process our music issue tickets.
The first is design to parse the body of the created issue ticket and prepare it for a JSON POST, while the second step does the actual system prompt and sends the post request to the API.

        with:
            name: Test results (all modes)
            path: ${{ steps.testRunner.outputs.artifactsPath }}

```

- Remember that you will need a valid Unity license for this action!

Here is step-by-step breakdown of a Unity GitHub Action

<Steps>
1.  **Define the Workflow**

    ```yaml
    name: Unity Test Runner
    ```
    - The `name` field sets the name of the workflow, making it easier to identify in the GitHub Actions tab.

2.  **Specify the Trigger Events**

    ```yaml
    on: [push, pull_request]
    ```

    - The `on` field specifies the events that trigger this workflow. Here, it triggers on `push` and `pull_request` events.

3.  **Define the Job and Environment**

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ```

    - The `jobs` field defines the jobs that will run as part of this workflow. The `test` job runs on the `ubuntu-latest` environment, which provides a clean and consistent Linux environment for running the tests.

4.  **Set Up the Matrix Strategy**

    ```yaml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        projectPath: [path/to/your/project]
        unityVersion: [2020.3.11f1, 2021.1.13f1]
    ```

    - The `matrix` strategy allows you to define multiple configurations for your jobs.
      Here, it sets up multiple Unity versions and project paths to test against, ensuring compatibility across different environments.

5.  **Checkout the Repository**

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
    ```

    - The `steps` field lists the steps in the job.
      The first step uses the `actions/checkout` action to clone the repository, providing access to the codebase for subsequent steps.

6.  **Cache Unity Packages**

    ```yaml
    - name: Cache Unity packages
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.local/share/unity3d/Unity/
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-unity-${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-unity-
    ```

    - Caching saves downloaded Unity packages between workflow runs, reducing the time needed for setup.
      The cache is identified by a unique key based on the runner OS and Unity version.

7.  **Run Unity Test Runner**

    ```yaml
    - name: Run Unity Test Runner
      uses: game-ci/unity-test-runner@v2.1.0
      id: testRunner
      env:
        UNITY_LICENSE: ${{ secrets.UNITY_LICENSE }}
      with:
        projectPath: ${{ matrix.projectPath }}
        unityVersion: ${{ matrix.unityVersion }}
        githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        customParameters: '-nographics'
    ```

    - This step runs the Unity Test Runner action:
      - `uses` specifies the action to run.
      - `id` gives this step an identifier for later reference.
      - `env` sets environment variables, including `UNITY_LICENSE`, which is essential for running Unity in batch mode.
      - `with` specifies parameters for the action:
        - `projectPath` sets the path to the Unity project.
        - `unityVersion` specifies the Unity version.
        - `githubToken` is used for authentication.
        - `customParameters` allows passing additional parameters to Unity, such as `-nographics` for headless execution.

8.  **Upload Test Results**

    ```yaml
    - name: Upload Test Results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      if: always()
      with:
        name: Test results (all modes)
        path: ${{ steps.testRunner.outputs.artifactsPath }}
    ```

    - This step uploads the test results as artifacts:
      - `if: always()` ensures this step runs regardless of the previous step’s outcome.
      - `with` specifies parameters for the upload:
        - `name` sets the artifact's name.
        - `path` specifies the file path to upload, using the output from the `testRunner` step.

</Steps>

<Aside>

- **Unity License**: Ensure you have a valid Unity license stored as a GitHub Secret **UNITY_LICENSE**. This license is required to run Unity in batch mode.
- **Matrix Strategy**: Testing against multiple Unity versions and project paths ensures comprehensive coverage and compatibility.
- **Caching**: Utilizing the cache can significantly speed up workflow runs by reusing previously downloaded Unity packages.
- **Artifact Upload**: Storing test results as artifacts allows you to review the outcomes of your tests even after the workflow completes, facilitating debugging and quality assurance.

</Aside>

When you finish following these steps, you will be setting up a robust and automated testing pipeline for your future Unity projects, enhancing your development workflow and ensuring higher code quality.

---

## Submodules

Git submodules are a powerful feature that allows you to include and manage external repositories within your own project.
By embedding one Git repository as a subdirectory of another, submodules enable the use of libraries or dependencies while maintaining their own version control.
This setup ensures that each submodule retains its history and can be updated independently, providing modularity and reducing code duplication.
Managing submodules requires specific commands to clone, update, and commit changes, but it offers a robust way to handle complex projects with multiple dependencies, keeping the main repository clean and organized.

<Aside>
These are notes and guides on how to build out submodules inside of Git, so that you can control certain plugins throughout multiple repos effortlessly.
This can go into private packages later on, if we need to.

The shift to the private packages will come as we grow bigger and require more control.

</Aside>

### Submodule Symbolic Link

Submodule symbolic links provide a method to seamlessly integrate multiple directories from different repositories without duplicating the contents.
By creating symbolic links, you can reference submodules in a way that allows for easy navigation and management within your main project directory.
This approach avoids the common pitfalls associated with managing multiple directories, such as redundancy and synchronization issues.
Symbolic links effectively act as shortcuts, pointing to the actual location of the submodule, thereby streamlining your workflow and maintaining a clean project structure.
Utilizing symbolic links in conjunction with submodules can significantly enhance the organization and efficiency of handling external dependencies in complex projects.

#### KBVE Module Example

Suppose we have already added our submodule for an Unity project, via `KBVE/UnitySubModule` and wanted to link them into our source, well this is how:

Create a folder inside of `Assets` named `Plugins` and then cd into it:

Example of the shell, do not copy and paste, make sure you read through the commands and swap out the right variables!

```shell
cd ./unityRootProject
cd ./Assets
mkdir Plugins
cd ./Plugins

```

Once inside the `Plugins` folder, we can execute the symbolic link using the `ln` command, like this:

```shell

ln -s ../../submodules/UnitySubModules/Vuplex

```

---

## Scripts

Script commands for Git act as powerful helper scripts that automate and streamline various Git operations.
These commands can simplify complex workflows by combining multiple Git actions into a single executable script.
For instance, shell commands can automate the process of staging changes, committing with a message, and pushing to the current branch, saving developers time and reducing the risk of errors.
Thus, by leveraging the flexibility of shell scripting, developers can create custom workflows tailored to their specific needs, enhancing productivity and ensuring consistent Git practices across projects.

### Commit

The `commit` command stages all changes, commits them with the message "Minor change sync," and pushes the commit to the current branch.
This sequence ensures that all modifications are saved and synchronized with the remote repository.

```sh
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) && git add . && git commit -m "Minor change sync" && git push origin $branch
```

This command does the following:

<Steps>

1.  **Environmentals**:

    ```shell
    branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
    ```

    Stores the current branch name in the `branch` variable.

2.  **Git Add**

    ```shell
    git add .
    ```

    Stages all changes.

3.  **Commit**

    ```shell
    git commit -m "Minor change sync"
    ```

    : Commits the changes with the message "Minor change sync".

4.  **Push**:

    ```shell
    git push origin $branch
    ```

    Pushes the changes to the current branch on the remote repository.

</Steps>

This way, you don't need to manually replace the branch name each time.
