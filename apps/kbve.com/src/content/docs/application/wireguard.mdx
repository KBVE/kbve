## Information

WireGuard is a modern, high-performance VPN application designed to be simple, fast, and secure.
It utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography to establish encrypted connections between devices, ensuring privacy and security over the internet.
Unlike traditional VPN solutions, WireGuard is lightweight, with a minimal codebase that reduces the potential for vulnerabilities and improves performance.
It is cross-platform, supporting major operating systems like Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, and is known for its ease of configuration and seamless integration into existing network infrastructures.
WireGuard's efficiency and robust security make it an ideal choice for both personal and enterprise use.


<Steps>

0.  **Tutorial**:

    This is a step-by-step tutorial on setting up WireGuard for a Kubernetes cluster to enable access to containers from different networks via WireGuard!

1.  **Prepare Kubernetes Cluster**:

    Ensure that you have a running Kubernetes cluster.
    You can use a managed service like GKE, EKS, or AKS, or set up your cluster using tools like Minikube, kubeadm, or k3s.

2.  **Install WireGuard on Nodes**:

    Install WireGuard on all Kubernetes nodes.
    The following instructions are for Ubuntu, but they can be adapted for other distributions.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y wireguard
    ```

3.  **Configure WireGuard Keys**:

    Generate WireGuard keys on each node. 
    
    This example below shows how to generate keys on a single node:

    ```bash
    umask 077
    wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
    ```

    Repeat this step for each node in the cluster and keep a record of each node's private and public keys.

4.  **Create WireGuard Configuration**:

    Create a WireGuard configuration file for each node.
    Below is an example configuration (`wg0.conf`) for a node:

    ```ini
    [Interface]
    PrivateKey = <Node_Private_Key>
    Address = 10.0.0.1/24
    ListenPort = 51820

    [Peer]
    PublicKey = <Peer_Node_Public_Key>
    Endpoint = <Peer_Node_IP>:51820
    AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
    PersistentKeepalive = 25
    ```

    - Replace `<Node_Private_Key>` with the node's private key.
    - Replace `<Peer_Node_Public_Key>` with the peer node's public key.
    - Replace `<Peer_Node_IP>` with the peer node's IP address.
    - Adjust the `Address` and `AllowedIPs` fields as needed.

5.  **Deploy WireGuard DaemonSet**:

    Create a Kubernetes DaemonSet to deploy WireGuard on all nodes.

    Save the following YAML to a file named `wireguard-daemonset.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: DaemonSet
    metadata:
    name: wireguard
    namespace: kube-system
    spec:
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        name: wireguard
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            name: wireguard
        spec:
        hostNetwork: true
        containers:
        - name: wireguard
            image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1  # Use a pause container
            securityContext:
            privileged: true
            volumeMounts:
            - name: wireguard-config
            mountPath: /etc/wireguard
            - name: lib-modules
            mountPath: /lib/modules
        volumes:
        - name: wireguard-config
            hostPath:
            path: /etc/wireguard
        - name: lib-modules
            hostPath:
            path: /lib/modules
    ```

    Deploy the DaemonSet:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f wireguard-daemonset.yaml
    ```


6.  **Create WireGuard ConfigMap**:

    Create a ConfigMap to store the WireGuard configuration files.
    Save the following YAML to a file named `wireguard-configmap.yaml`, and include the configuration for each node:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    name: wireguard-config
    namespace: kube-system
    data:
    wg0.conf: |
        [Interface]
        PrivateKey = <Node1_Private_Key>
        Address = 10.0.0.1/24
        ListenPort = 51820

        [Peer]
        PublicKey = <Node2_Public_Key>
        Endpoint = <Node2_IP>:51820
        AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
        PersistentKeepalive = 25

        [Peer]
        PublicKey = <Node3_Public_Key>
        Endpoint = <Node3_IP>:51820
        AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32
        PersistentKeepalive = 25
    ```

    Replace the placeholders with actual keys and IPs.
    
    Apply the ConfigMap:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f wireguard-configmap.yaml
    ```

7.  **Create WireGuard Init Container**:

    Modify the DaemonSet to include an init container that sets up WireGuard. 
    
    Update `wireguard-daemonset.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: DaemonSet
    metadata:
    name: wireguard
    namespace: kube-system
    spec:
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        name: wireguard
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            name: wireguard
        spec:
        hostNetwork: true
        initContainers:
        - name: setup-wireguard
            image: busybox
            command: ["sh", "-c", "cp /etc/wireguard-config/wg0.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf && wg-quick up wg0"]
            volumeMounts:
            - name: wireguard-config
            mountPath: /etc/wireguard-config
            - name: wireguard
            mountPath: /etc/wireguard
        containers:
        - name: wireguard
            image: k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1
            securityContext:
            privileged: true
            volumeMounts:
            - name: wireguard
            mountPath: /etc/wireguard
            - name: lib-modules
            mountPath: /lib/modules
        volumes:
        - name: wireguard-config
            configMap:
            name: wireguard-config
        - name: wireguard
            hostPath:
            path: /etc/wireguard
        - name: lib-modules
            hostPath:
            path: /lib/modules
    ```

    Update the DaemonSet:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f wireguard-daemonset.yaml
    ```

8.  **Verify WireGuard Setup**:

    Check the status of WireGuard on each node:

    ```bash
    sudo wg
    ```

    You should see the WireGuard interface `wg0` and its peers.

9.  **Access Containers Across Networks**:

    Now, your nodes are connected via WireGuard.
    You can access containers across different networks by using the WireGuard IP addresses.
    
    For example, if you have a pod on Node 1 with a WireGuard IP of `10.0.0.1`, you can access it from Node 2 using that IP.

10. **Conclusion**:

    You have successfully set up WireGuard on a Kubernetes cluster, enabling secure communication between containers across different networks.
    This setup can be expanded and customized to fit more complex networking requirements.

## Docker

Installing WireGuard on Docker!

-   Docker Compose

    -   Github
        	src="data/wireguard/docker-compose.yml"
        	description="This is a docker compose for wireguard."
        - Embed is disabled as of right now.

-   Ubuntu Installation Guide
    -   Core Pre-Installation
        -   Make sure your docker install is setup! If you need more information, please visit our Docker application page.
        -   Check your firewall, are you using `ufw` , `iptables` or `nftables`
    -   Firewall
        -   Wireguard will be operating on the `UDP` port of `51820`.
        -   For: `ufw`
            -   To enable the port through `ufw` run `sudo allow 51821/udp`

## Netmaker

-   Netmaker is a Wireguard automation application that handles self-hosted homelabs to small business / enterprise networking.
-   [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker)

### Netmaker Install

-   Advance install for netmaker allows the setup of a highly available installation within Kubernetes through helm.
-   The _default_ settings may not install `wireguard` at the kernel level (for security reasons) and default to Postgres for storage.
    -   Not having kernel level wireguard may cause performance drops and they recommend that you install wireguard before beginning.
-   Helm Install Commands:

    -   ```shell
        helm repo add netmaker https://gravitl.github.io/netmaker-helm/
        helm repo update
        ```

    -   If you do not have `helm` or `kubernetes` setup, we recommend you visit our [kubernetes setup](https://kbve.com/application/kubernetes).

-   The storage of the certificates will be an issue for this netmaker cluster, they recommend two types of storage classes:
    -   `RWO` - `Read Write Once` - Storage instance where only a single node is allowed to access the storage volume at a time for read and write access.
    -   `RWX` - `Read Write Many` - Storage instance where many nodes can concurrently read and write to the storage volume.
