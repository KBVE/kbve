## Information

Rust is a modern systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety, concurrency, and high performance without sacrificing control over system resources.
Developed by Mozilla and now maintained by the Rust Foundation, it is designed to address common issues found in other languages like C and C++, such as null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows, through its powerful ownership model and strict compile-time checks.
Rust's expressive type system, robust package manager (Cargo), and thriving ecosystem make it a popular choice for building reliable and efficient software, from operating systems and game engines to web servers and command-line tools.

## Install

<Aside>

This tutorial is intended for users on Linux, MacOS, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). 
Windows users should follow the instructions for setting up WSL to use this guide effectively.

</Aside>

Installing Rust on Linux, MacOS, or WSL involves using the `rustup` tool, which manages the Rust installation and its associated tools.
You can install `rustup` by running a simple `curl` command in the terminal and following the prompts to complete the setup.
After configuring your shell and verifying the installation, you'll have a fully functional Rust development environment ready for use.

<Steps>

1.  **Install Rust using `rustup`**:

    Open a terminal and run the following command to download and install the `rustup` tool, which will manage your Rust installation.

    ```shell
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    Follow the prompts during the installation process to proceed with the default installation options. If the installation is successful, you will see a message indicating that Rust has been installed.

2.  **Configure Your Shell**:

    After the installation is complete, you need to configure your current shell session to use Rust by running the following command:

    ```shell
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

    This command ensures that Rust and its associated tools are available in your shell environment.

3.  **Verify the Installation**:

    To confirm that Rust has been installed correctly, check the version of the Rust compiler with the following command:

    ```shell
    rustc --version
    ```

    This command should display the installed version of Rust, indicating that the installation was successful.

4.  **Install Required Dependencies**:

    Rust requires a linker to combine its compiled outputs into one file. You may need to install additional tools if you encounter linker errors.

    **On Ubuntu/Debian**:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
    ```

    **On Fedora**:

    ```shell
    sudo dnf groupinstall 'Development Tools'
    ```

    **On Arch Linux**:

    ```shell
    sudo pacman -S base-devel
    ```

    **On MacOS**:

    Install Xcode command line tools, which include a C compiler and linker.

    ```shell
    xcode-select --install
    ```

5.  **Update Rust**:

    Keep your Rust installation up-to-date with the following command:

    ```shell
    rustup update
    ```

6.  **Configure Your Development Environment**:

    To make the most of Rust, you should set up a development environment.

    **Install Visual Studio Code** (optional):

    VS Code is a popular code editor with excellent support for Rust.

    **On Linux**:

    ```shell
    sudo snap install --classic code
    ```

    **On MacOS**:

    Download and install from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

    **Install the Rust extension for VS Code**:

    Open VS Code and install the "rust-analyzer" extension for Rust language support.

    **Set up your first Rust project**:

    ```shell
    cargo new hello_world
    cd hello_world
    cargo run
    ```

    This will create a new Rust project named `hello_world`, navigate into the project directory, and run the sample application.

7.  **Explore Rust Documentation**:

    Rust has extensive documentation and a friendly community. Here are some resources to get you started:

    - [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
    - [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
    - [Official Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)


</Steps>

## Update

Updating Rust is simple and straightforward using the `rustup` tool.
By running the `rustup update` command in your terminal, you can ensure that your Rust installation and all associated components are kept up-to-date with the latest stable versions.

<Steps>

1. **Open a Terminal**:

    Ensure that you have access to a terminal on your Linux, MacOS, or WSL system.

2. **Run the `rustup` Update Command**:

    Use the following command to update Rust and all installed components to the latest version:

    ```shell
    rustup update
    ```

    This command will download and install the latest stable version of Rust and update all installed toolchains.

3. **Verify the Update**:

    After the update process is complete, verify that Rust has been updated successfully by checking the version:

    ```shell
    rustc --version
    ```

    This command should display the latest version of Rust, confirming that the update was successful.

4. **Clean Up Old Versions** (optional):

    To free up disk space, you can remove older versions of Rust that are no longer needed by running:

    ```shell
    rustup self uninstall
    ```

    This command will prompt you to confirm the removal of old toolchains and components.

</Steps>

## Cargo

<Aside>
> TLDR; Cargo is a package manager for Rust that handles the dependencies, compiling and distribution.

> Cargo can publish your package to **crates.io** so that it can be used with other applications within Rust.
</Aside>

Cargo is the Rust package manager and build system, designed to streamline the process of managing dependencies, compiling code, and building projects.
It simplifies tasks like creating new projects, running tests, and generating documentation with easy-to-use commands.
Cargo ensures that Rust developers can efficiently manage their projects' libraries and tools, maintaining consistency and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.

<Steps>

1. **Install Rust and Cargo**:

    Cargo comes bundled with Rust, so installing Rust also installs Cargo. If you haven't installed Rust yet, follow the installation steps below:

    Open a terminal and run the following command:

    ```shell
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

    Follow the prompts to complete the installation. Once Rust is installed, Cargo will be installed automatically.

2. **Verify Cargo Installation**:

    To ensure Cargo is installed correctly, check its version by running:

    ```shell
    cargo --version
    ```

    This command should display the installed version of Cargo, confirming the installation was successful.

3. **Create a New Rust Project**:

    Use Cargo to create a new Rust project by running:

    ```shell
    cargo new my_project
    cd my_project
    ```

    This command creates a new directory named `my_project` with the necessary files and structure for a Rust project.

4. **Build the Project**:

    To compile your Rust project, navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```shell
    cargo build
    ```

    This command compiles your project and produces an executable in the `target/debug` directory.

5. **Run the Project**:

    After building your project, you can run it with:

    ```shell
    cargo run
    ```

    This command compiles (if necessary) and runs your project, displaying any output in the terminal.

6. **Add Dependencies**:

    To add external libraries (dependencies) to your project, edit the `Cargo.toml` file in your project directory and add the desired dependencies under the `[dependencies]` section. For example:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    serde = "1.0"
    ```

    After adding dependencies, run:

    ```shell
    cargo build
    ```

    Cargo will download and compile the specified dependencies for your project.

7. **Run Tests**:

    To run tests defined in your project, use:

    ```shell
    cargo test
    ```

    This command compiles and runs any tests found in the `tests` directory or within your source files.

8. **Generate Documentation**:

    Cargo can generate documentation for your project and its dependencies. To generate and view the documentation, run:

    ```shell
    cargo doc --open
    ```

    This command generates HTML documentation and opens it in your default web browser.

9. **(Optional) Install Cargo Watch**:

    Cargo Watch automatically runs Cargo commands when file changes are detected, useful for continuous development.

    **Install Cargo Watch**:

    ```shell
    cargo install cargo-watch
    ```

    **Use Cargo Watch**:

    To automatically recompile your project when you make changes, run:

    ```shell
    cargo watch -x build
    ```

    For automatic testing on file changes, use:

    ```shell
    cargo watch -x test
    ```
