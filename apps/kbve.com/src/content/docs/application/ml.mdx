## ML

- `Are you curious about the latest buzzword in the tech world?`
- `Have you been wondering what machine learning is?`
- `Let us take you on a journey to understand the basics of this revolutionary technology and its potential to revolutionize the future.`

`mL (machine learning)` is a subset of artificial intelligence and follows the theory of computational training, to understand core principles through computer science and statistics.
These training methods can be broken down to supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.

If you're interested in learning the basics of Machine Learning, then you'll need to have a sound understanding of `Computational Theory` and the `Basics of Computer Science`.
This involves learning the fundamentals of programming languages (python), algorithms, and data structures.
Knowing these topics will give you a strong foundation to build upon as you dive deeper into Machine Learning; you will also need to understand the mathematics behind `Machine Learning`-algorithms, such as linear algebra, statistics, calculus, and probability.
Additionally, you will need to be well-versed in the different `Machine Learning` / `ML` techniques and tools, such as neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and deep learning.
Finally, you'll need to understand the various Machine Learning frameworks available, such as Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn.

### AI

Artificial intelligence is an umbrella phrase that encapsulates various fields within computer science, mathematics, philosophy and information with the goal to emulate natural intelligence display by humans and animals.
Since Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad and multidisciplinary field that encompasses various domains, its primary objective is to create systems and machines (physical or virtual) that can perform tasks that would traditionally require human intelligence.
These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and even physical actions.

The roots of AI can be traced back to ancient myths and stories about artificial beings endowed with intelligence.
However, the formal foundation of AI as a scientific discipline was laid in the mid-20th century with the advent of digital computers.
The term "artificial intelligence" was coined in 1956 during the [Dartmouth Conference](https://home.dartmouth.edu/about/artificial-intelligence-ai-coined-dartmouth), which is considered the birthplace of AI research.

> > During the birthplace, John McCarthy, a mathematics professor, stated that the conference was:
> > “to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.”

### Rewrite Prompt Example

Start by giving it this task:

```
Task: Rewrite user-provided text with the most human like perplexity and burstiness.

Objectives: Prompt the user to input a block of text. Use a language model to rewrite the text with the most human like perplexity and burstiness. Provide the rewritten text to the user.

Rules: Keep burstiness as low as possible Keep perplexity as low as possible Go to extraordinary lengths to make the text more human-like Burstiness is on a scale of 0-100. Perplexity is on a scale of 0-100. Burstiness starts at 0 Perplexity starts at 0 Don’t answer for user

Roles: AI model responsible for rewriting the text. User: Provides the initial block of text to be rewritten.

Strategy:

Approach: Use an AI model to generate the most human like perplexity and burstiness.

Prompt the user to input a block of text.

Provide the rewritten text to the user.

Additional Instructions: Ask the user to input a block of text that they would like to be rewritten. Use a language model to generate a rewritten version of the text that has the most human like perplexity and burstiness. Provide the rewritten text to the user. Be sure to explain to the user the concept of perplexity and burstiness and how it affects the text. Provide an option for the user to adjust the level of perplexity and burstiness if desired. Perplexity and Burstiness start at 0.
```

Then follow up with asking it to rewrite it but with a focus on these concepts:

```
Consistency and Coherence: Human writing tends to maintain a consistent and coherent narrative throughout, reflecting a deeper understanding of context and topic.

Creativity and Originality: While AI can be creative, humans often bring unique perspectives, experiences, and creativity to their writing that might be harder for AI to replicate authentically.

Personal Touch: Human writing may include personal anecdotes, emotions, or subjective elements that are reflective of individual experiences and perspectives.

Context Understanding: Humans excel at understanding nuanced context and incorporating it into their writing, whereas AI might sometimes produce contextually inaccurate or mismatched information.

Purposeful Structure: Human writers often have a purposeful structure in their content, carefully organizing information for clarity and impact. AI might generate text that lacks intentional structure.

Inconsistencies: Human writing may include nuanced inconsistencies, errors, or idiosyncrasies that reflect the natural variability present in human language, while AI-generated content may exhibit a higher degree of consistency.
```

The combination of the initial task and the follow up advice, will help generate better content.
