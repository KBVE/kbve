## Introduction

In a world constantly spinning on the axis of change, human endeavors have often revolved around one perennial quest: `to make life easier`.
From the intricate levers of ancient civilizations to the steam engines of the Industrial Revolution, our innate desire has always been to achieve more by doing less.
Enter the realm of automation software – the silent maestro orchestrating a symphony of machines, applications, and digital systems.

Imagine, if you will, a pianist. Each keystroke produces a note, each note a melody, and each melody a song. 
Now imagine if that pianist could simultaneously play multiple pianos, producing a harmonized tune that fills the air with a complexity and depth that one could only dream of achieving alone.
That is the magic of automation software. It takes our singular tasks and multiplies them, synchronizing each action to produce an outcome greater than the sum of its parts.

The digital age has ushered in a vast landscape of opportunities, and with it, an overwhelming array of tasks that require precision, repetition, and scale.
Automation software steps in like a seasoned conductor, guiding each instrument in this vast digital orchestra to play its part flawlessly.
Whether it's a business process that needs streamlining, data that requires analysis, or mundane tasks that sap human creativity, automation ensures that efficiency is not just achieved, but optimized.

As we embark on this journey to understand the intricacies of automation software, remember that at its heart, it's not just about coding or algorithms; it's about amplifying human potential.
It's about carving out space for innovation and creativity by letting machines handle the repetitive and the routine.
And as we stand at the precipice of the future, there's no doubt that the dance of machines, choreographed by automation software, will lead the way.

The goal of this document is to provide references and links to different automation libraries and applications that you can utilize in your software adventures!

## Simba

Simba software is an open source automation software designed for repeatable mouse/keyboard tasks that follow a generic linear timeline.
The software's primary functionality is locating colours / pixels within the screen of choice, then moving the mouse to click the x and y coordinates of the colour / pixel.
