## Notes

### 2024

#### Windows

It might be time to switch the build process towards focusing on the Steam and Windows build for the unity game!
While I did enjoy some of the WebGL/WASM process, I think for the sake of time, I am go ing to push forward the steam build, as it is over due.

I am not going to drop the WASM/WebGL build completely but I will come back to it later on, when there is abetter WebGPU support.

Since we are going to use Unity DOTs, which does not build to WebGL, so we have to change that to `StandaloneWindows64`.

That means editing the pipeline, `ci-alpha`, and comment out all the `WebGL`.

While I am testing the build pipeline, I am going to add the `Toon RP` as a render engine because it would help resolve some of the style issues that I was having earlier.
