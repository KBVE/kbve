## Notes

### 2024

#### Windows

It might be time to switch the build process towards focusing on the Steam and Windows build for the unity game!
While I did enjoy some of the WebGL/WASM process, I think for the sake of time, I am go ing to push forward the steam build, as it is over due.

I am not going to drop the WASM/WebGL build completely but I will come back to it later on, when there is abetter WebGPU support.
