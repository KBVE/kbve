## Notes

### 2024

#### Journal

I am going to test case the new renders of the journal entries within the migrated kbve.com.

The color scheme is already making the text a bit hard to read but I suppose keeping the default white font is the best move, then adding a couple hues of blue.

The next question that I have in my mind is how would I go about doing the color gradients?

The color palette that I am thinking might look something like this:

Main Color , base cyan
- Hex: `#91ffff`
- RGB: `(145,255,255)`

Additional colors
- Hex: `#08a4a7	(8,164,167)`
- Hex: `#e9ffff	(233,255,255)`
- Hex: `#4dfed1	(77,254,209)`
- Hex: `#0bdbb6	(11,219,182)`

These are not the final colors but give us a bit of range to understand how it would look.

We do need to create a new logo around these colors as well, which I will assign to an agent.


#### Security

There are some older journal notes for security, we have to migrate them over to the new monorepo.

The two subjects as of right now are just `xss` and `firewall`, but we could include some additional subjects?

I think an entry for auth should be included as a future aspect, including how to handle jwt, password reset and 2fa.
