## 2024

**Market**
The market was brutal this morning, but I see it as a quick sale!
I am going to load up my 2024 Roth today, quickly grabbing what I can for around $7K but I might also be above the income to contribute.
If I end up going too high for this year, then I will just sell out and readjust or pay the fees, it is what it is.

**Margin**
The margin on one of my accounts is starting to creep up a bit and after a couple CDs clear up within the next couple months, I should plan to wipe that out.
That would mean that I am now really debt free within my personal name.
I was hoping to keep that margin afloat until the end of the year but there just isnt anything worth trading that makes enough to cover the interest on the capital.

**MemoryLeak**
When pulling back the data points, I noticed that the KBVE API was at around 35MB and not the 14MB that a fresh API would have.
I am trying to figure out the 20MB+ increase in the usage of the API running for over 2 months was from caching, maybe a static hash map increasing in size or the worse case, a memory leak.
While the memory leak would not be the end of the world, I believe it would be wise to look over the code and keep track of the changes.
The most recent parts that we added were Groq / mL / ai helper routes, but I do not think that they would cause that issue.
I am thinking that it is an Arc pointer issue or the way that I am handling the application state.
When I put my rusty hat back on, it will require a decent deep dive.

**Zod**
Here is the MapData as a Zod:

```ts

const PointSchema = z.object({
  x: z.number(),
  y: z.number(),
});

const INPCPositionSchema = PointSchema.extend({
  id: z.string().optional(),
});

const INPCObjectGPSSchema = z.object({
  ulid: z.string(),
  position: INPCPositionSchema,
});

const BoundsSchema = z.object({
  xMin: z.number(),
  xMax: z.number(),
  yMin: z.number(),
  yMax: z.number(),
});

const IMapDataSchema = z.object({
  bounds: BoundsSchema,
  tilemapKey: z.string(),
  tilesetName: z.string(),
  tilesetLayer: z.string(),
  tilesetImageUrl: z.string(),
  tilesetKey: z.string(),
  scale: z.number(),
  npcs: z.array(INPCObjectGPSSchema),
  jsonDataUrl: z.string(),
});


```

## 2023
- 4:40pm - The first couple of Ubuntu GitLab actions had worked fine but a couple of the latter
- 6:45pm - All my chores are done and I believe it might be time for a couple quick league matches. I did some off the record journal entries because I wanted to take a bit of a break from the screen, so I will have to migrate them back to this md document. I feel like this is one of the only major drawbacks with doing a daily journal, it is trying to remember to take your physical notes and then convert them over to a digital format. I suppose the other side of it is realizing some of the notes are a bit stupid, but then again, even if they are a bit out of the norm, it might still make sense to document them. 
- 6:49pm - Should I go AP shaco or another round of tank shaco? Hmm, I also think the two new skins are okay, they could have done a bit more with the effects, I feel like the animation game was a bit weak but that might be just on my end. About to hit that 2 million mastery, which is a bit scary to think about. 
- 6:59pm - After I finish up the tag system, I should go back and refactor some of the media content, maybe that might give me a really good static API base to work with. One of the random ideas that I was thinking to add into the Discord music bot was to pull the json data for the YouTube content and basically play music from those tags? I could do a `musicbot` specific tag and extend it out? Hmm, I suppose how would I go about a duel tag search, so if object is on tag A and tag B? I guess this goes into the relationship style of tagging, such that, multiple entities could be linked via cross-tag. These are some questions that I have to think through as I build it out.
- 9:51pm - Seeing Futurama come back after being canceled over and over, I am surprised and somewhat glad the show is back... ugh again after being canceled? So far it is exactly the perfect balance of science and meme.  
- 10:36pm  - Going to sync the patch and preparing the next patch for tomorrow..
- 11:30pm - I should look into libraries that help the movement of the mouse, the two that I was looking at where pyHM and WindMouse, both could be combined into just one unique package? I suppose this would be something that we would operate under NodePy later down the line, in terms of automation as well.
