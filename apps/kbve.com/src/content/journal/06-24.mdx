## 2024

**Conch Shell**

Time to bring back a classic application! I will probably host the conch shell directly under the `/tools/` under the `conch.mdx`.
We could also throw our prompt into that mixture, since that was a pain point before in the past couple rounds.
I believe we can stick to the default of a true / false for the start of the application, and then go about adding more features later down the line.

**Mic**

New mic? Who Dis!
After searching far, wide and low, I might have found the perfect mic, its the Alpha Cloud from HyperX!
This bad boy has a battery life of over 300 hours!

**Jedi**

We will expand the jedi library so that it can call a couple different endpoints!
The next file that we will be adding into the library is the `featherless.rs` which will be a wrapper around their API service!
I am currently building around their API but I do not have access to test it, so we shall see how far we can get with it.

One of the cooler things that I want to do is to try to build around the Semaphore / SegQueue, both of these being part of a stable concurrent call system.
The final goal will be to have multiple different LLMs communicate in a real time.

**Villows**

Just stumbled upon a new artist called Villows and a decent chunk of his music has been amazing! WoW!
I will have to parse through all of his work and throw it into the jukebox.
Now there are some parts of this that I need to further automate but we are getting some solid gems out here.
Very much helping me solve my petite biscuit requirements.

```bash

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=chillstep --title='Villows & Niicap - Dimmest Light' --ytid=jwTOq65qaWA"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=chillstep --title='Villows - Coast' --ytid=6vOUyl4EvL0"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=chillstep --title='Villows - Endless' --ytid=ygcLDN4GgkU"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=chillstep --title='Villows - Childhood' --ytid=wcuAXzt55LY"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=chillstep --title='Villows - Mountains' --ytid=1HT47cz8yVA"

```

We should also add a bunch of the rise against and adtr before we forget.

```bash 

```

Quick Porter Mashup?

```bash

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=edm --title='Porter Robinson - Sea of Voices x Shelter x Divinity (Resaixo Mashup)' --ytid=uPBpmz1Z32w"
