### 2024

#### Tickets

I feel like a ticket system works well when keeping track of the conflicts, bugs, upgrades, but no one seems to really answer them.
However, I should just keep to myself and continue to answer tickets, even if it means that I am talking to myself? I feel like the premise of the tickets are just to cover yourself.

I should look further into developing out the AI ticket response system but that is still way down the pipeline.

#### NX

#### WASM

We were able to get the WASM embed to push into two different folders, one for HerbMail.com, which is a placeholder for the public facing test case.
The other one that I added today is for the next KBVE.com release, both of which are done via NX and a custom shell script.

Now the next issue would be to update the `wasm.md` to either a new `wasm.mdx` or something unique for the tool.
However I am thinking of isolating the tools to their own custom astro file.

This will just make the process of building the tools out easier for other websites too.

#### RSPS

Decided to pickup another account for our adventures! Obviously I will not include the name but we shall see how far we can get with this!

I think if we plan around it and make sure everything works, then we should not have any major issues. Let us see how everything plays out over time.
