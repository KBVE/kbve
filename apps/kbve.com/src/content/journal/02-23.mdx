### 2024

#### Expo

After playing around with expo a couple times throughout my life, back in the painful days and recently with an older rentearth application, I decided to pull the trigger and integrate the expo into the NX.
The NX integration is on my plate for this weekend, but there are a couple things that I know will cause issues, like making sure the iOS and Android pipeline work for a generic application.
Then after making sure that they work for a barebone html app, the real challenge will arise... which is getting the WASM embed that we made earlier to load into iOS and Android.

I will have to keep some distance with expo because I do not want to waste a bunch of time debugging random bugs over and over.

#### Tickets

I will try to work around the Github tickets again, at least to keep track of the changes within the monorepo!

I am doing a solid job of keeping track of the issue tickets at work but I should not be lazy, ugh becoming complacent is a terrible thing to break out of.

The loop of doing nothing!

Okay we got 6 new tickets onto the board, hopefully we can hit around 50 by the end of this month!

#### Pipeline

Lets test out the pipeline for the KBVE.com build and have it push the code out into another repo!
Just like how we are building the herbmail.com, we are basically swapping out the variables with kbve.com, thus making this process easier than I expected.

Under the `ci-main.yml` , we will extend the build and deployment, by copying over the two actions and switching the variables.

* **Action One** - Build the application using NX, since we already have that setup, while I am writing this out, I am going to test case it.

* **Action Two** - Deploy the source code. We will push the `/dist/` code from `dist/apps/kbve.com` to the `kbve/kbve.com` repo and under the docs folder.

We will have it push the `dev` branch but my concern might be that it will fail because there is no `docs` folder. Now there are two options that I am thinking through, should I run the action knowing that it will fail because the `docs` folder is not there? OR should I resolve that future problem now.

Ideally we want to run the action and have it fail at that error point, then go in and resolve it from that error point; the error point is a bit of a foresight and a good spot to have it fail at.

Eh, actually I will just quickly create a patch to resolve this issue before we run into it. 
The patch for `kbve/kbve.com` is `adding docs`, which just creates the `docs` folder and places the a simple `README.md` into the location.
I could have place a `.gitkeep` as well but that is a different story.
