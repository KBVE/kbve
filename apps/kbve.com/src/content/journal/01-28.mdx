### 2024

    -   9:53am  -   `Refactor`

        #### Refactor

            The `kbve` package has a couple errors that needs to be addressed, which are mainly because the user table has `userid` now instead of `ulid` as a reference.
            
            Issue one would be under the `guild.rs` but now how should I refactor it? 

            For now I am just updating the references to the `ulid` table as `userid`, since we want to make sure the column names match for the inner/left joins.

            However during the `cargo test`, I noticed the holy crate was broken too, which means I need to go back and fix that as well xD!

            The issue with the holy crate would be the observers, which I have addressed.

            Going back to the `kbve` package and `rust_wasm_embed`, I reset the `hcaptcha` key within the database and we are running into some verification issues.

            To help resolve this, I am going to pull the dev server replication from `5` units to `1` and see what the problem is when it comes to the verification, which is most likely something stupid hehe.
