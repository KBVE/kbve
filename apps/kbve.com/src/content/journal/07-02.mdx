## 2024

**Cough**

- 11:00am

Damn, I caught a terrible viral bug and my body is fighting this thing to the end of earth.
I have not yet taken any anti-viral medicine but if things get bad, then I might have to pop some anti-biotics.
Greek yogurt has been a life savior, my logic is that if I fill myself up with healthy bacteria, it would make it harder for the evil ones to get a hold of my immunity system.

**Issue Tickets**

- 1:45pm
  I need to get into the grind of updating the issue tickets more often.
  My private kanban is looking great but I think getting a public one that is opertional and synced would be a great benefit in the long term.

## 2023

- 5:45pm - Going through all my monthly statements, just to make sure that everything will be paid off. I have to contact my insurance agent soon too, as I want to see if I can get a further discount on my car insurance. Usually I pay 6 months in advance, hopefully she can find me a better rate.
- 5:50pm - Having some minor flowbite issues, I am thinking that I will add their react library and call the javascript that I need directly within the jsx file for the time being. I have it noted and I will go back and alter it when I get some time. This would be a hot fix but I need to get the basic login working within Unity. I also noticed that this login solution will not work for WebGL games, but in that situation, I will just use the ReactUnity to handle that. I am like not too far from just rebuilding a cyperpunk neopets lmao.
- 9:00pm - I am thinking of cooking some ramen with spinach and egg! I am currently looking for recipes to work with. I am thinking of cooking the ramen and then add the layer of spinach near the end? Hmm, now there are a couple ways I could go about cooking this but I wanted to make sure I do not over cook the noodles or the eggs. I am a bit too lazy to weight out the spinach, so I am just going to throw all of it.
