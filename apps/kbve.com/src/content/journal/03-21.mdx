## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### LCAgents

For LC Agents we will setup an expo client that we can build test around and finish up a generic website for the client.

We will use the `Argon React Native` Template as the base for the LC Agents website!

This will help with moving the application fast and near production ready!

This will involve turning all the JS files into TSX and then making sure that they are functional, with the right imports.

Oh this is a massive hole we are in right now! Over 100+ errors!
We will go through each file, break them down and turn it into the right typesafe component!
