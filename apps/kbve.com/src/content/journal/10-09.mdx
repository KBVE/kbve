## 2024


**Vuplex**

The plan for today will be to focus on getting the vuplex to communicate with the kbve website.
We are going to continue from yesterday, expanding the vuplex postmessage and event listeners, possibly linking them together with our kilobase events.
Created a helper class under the `Utils` namespace, these are things we can integrate into a final nuget package that will help us in the future game development.

We been making some progress with this part of the vuplex, we can move the data from the kbve website and unity client without any major problems.
However we do need to grab the session and refresh token from the javascript side and then use it to build the supabase client within the unity side.
This way we can then close out the WebView and use just this token to handle our game management!

As for what I understand, we can also also have this operate in an offline mode too but that will be something that we can look into the future.

**NuGet**

Moving all our core code into a namespace would make sense because then we can reuse all of it in the future?
I am thinking we keep parts of the code still isolated, while building out the game but at the same time, we can consolidate the older legacy code into a `KBVE` namespace.
The goal here would be to eventually release it under a nuget package and start to reutilize the code in future projects.
There might be some side-effects but we do not want this to be aimed at the general public, but rather leverage the open source eco-system to create our own hybrid source.
Parts of our game's core codebase being open source is not going to hurt us, but only help us move forward.

**MainTemplate**

Added a minor boolean to the `MainTemplate.astro` that will disable the footer, thus making it a bit easier to handle certain pages on WebView.
Our `unity.astro` under the `auth` should not provide a footer nor a navigation bar!
This should make it a bit easier to handle the resolution of the login page too, since it will not have to render those objects and take up vital space.
