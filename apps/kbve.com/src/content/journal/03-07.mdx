## Notes

### 2024

#### Airport

The early mornings are tough but what always makes it worse are the trips to the damn airport.
I do not mind the drive to the airport but the traffic and finding parking, well both of those are `deez to the hammer`.
Let me get my morning coffee and make sure my notes are a bit more in sync.

#### GM

I thought it would make sense to split some of my time up and try to read through this game master book!
My plan is to read through it here and there, making notes on every single page.
This is the same style of reading that I have done in the past, but this time I will try to convert some of those notes that I take into markdown. 
The goal of this reading adventure is to take the information and process it into future useful tools for others to use.
