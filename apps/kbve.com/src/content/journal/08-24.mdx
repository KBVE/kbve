**Expo**

I forget how much I hate and also enjoy the world of expo!
Making a couple quick updates and check-ins before going straight to sleep, I am tired and had a long day.
The wedding is over and now I am about to rest, calling it a good night.

**WoW**

Trying to install WoW on my m3, but I am not too sure if I will be able to run the whole game tonight!
I do have get some rest, but knowing that it can be installed and runs on native m3 is a huge win in my book.

**Lucca**

Traveling around some more remote parts of Italy and I can not wait to ride the trains around.
There was a point where I want to train hop and free float like a homeless bum throughout Italy.
However I do enjoy my sleep and a warm shower, but If I could get away with it, I would.

**New Fabric**

The core of RN is going under a new framework with the release of react 18 around the corner.
This new framework for react native should be easy to integrate and add into our eco-system, but there will be some minor changes that we will have to do ahead of time.
We need to pass through all the variables to enable the new framework but also make sure that it will not break anything else.

**Legal**

Under the current legal framework, there might be adjustments that have to be made!

## 2023

- 8:40am - Nvdia's bubble is insane but also the fact that they have a margin of around almost 70% is mind blowing. 

- 9:45am - Okay we are seeing some pull back from the markets but I need to focus on some of the stuff for work, so I will keep this journal a bit small in that sense.

- 6:00pm - Finally finished up with the general work related tasks, the backup recovery is still having some issues that I need to migrate and fix but I will test case that on my own time. 

- 7:20pm - Currently making sure all my accounts are ready for the hackathon tomorrow and that includes making sure we have the basics out of the way. 

- 8:08pm - There was an issue with the Business operations aka BizOps document not rendering the graphs, so I will fix that right now.
