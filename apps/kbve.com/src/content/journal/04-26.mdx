## 2024

Just working on the internal aspects of the KBVE Monorepo!
I am thinking about the best way to handle the layout system right now.

**Arcade**

We made some minor changes to the arcade earlier this week!
I am hoping to wrap up the changes before the end of today!
The hero looks terrible and needs to be updated to fit the arcade, also we need to remove the scrolling.

**Webmaster**

Started to build out the webmaster tool, which was built a couple times in the past.
I am just updating the older codebase and rewriting the basics of it.
Hmm, other than that, its been a slow Friday!

## 2023

-   Learning GraphQL. Okay we got the basics of the AppWrite integration, i.e login, signup and user profile but there is no subscribe yet.
-   The newest restaurant that I enjoyed was `Indian Spices 4U, Manjalpur, Vadodara` , and it was damn amazing. They have an all you can eat / lunch special, so starve yourself for the whole day and then binge out on amazing egg dishes. I recommend asking for boiled eggs on the side, with no salt/pepper and then dropping them crushed into the curry gravy.
