## Notes

### 2024

#### NX

I spent a decent amount of time rebuilding the NX Smartrepo pipeline, we were able to get updated to version 18 but it seems that the Rust plugin was throwing errors.

We had to downgrade the Rust plugin from the version of 1.3.3 back to version 1.2.X, which was able to then build and run without any problems.

The plugin upgrade was causing a null point error within nodejs, thus causing the whole pipeline to break!

It seems that I can never get away from null point errors, even in RUST! just kidding, it was all nodejs bullypoopy.


#### PackageHell

It seems that I had entered package hell because of the amount of dependencies were all over the place, some of them not published, causing a weird vendor loop.

Nx Graph kept looking for version 0.1.2 of `holy` but the workspace had a version of 0.1.3, which caused a weird bug in the graphing system.


#### RustWASM

Running the Rust WASM is currently with this command:
- `./kbve.sh -nx rust_wasm_embed:trunkserve`
