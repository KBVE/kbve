## 2024

**Fleet**

This will be our next attempt at deployment through ranchers fleet, again there are some random issues that might be from how we setup the fleet.yaml?
Back into the `/migrations/kube/charts/armada` we will be going into and making adjustments to help with the deployment.
I am going to go back and try a completely different approach with setting up the charts for armada, maybe having the armada be its own internal chart and then reference the bitnami charts as a dependency.
This might work out better in the long term but we still need to add the kustomize!
For that part of the requirement, I will come back around after it is deployed and replicated and make a `base`, `dev`, `prod`, ect...

**RAW**

Watching this horror flim called RAW, which is in french and so far its been great!
I think the main actress is also super cute xD
Nevermind, I am way too afraid of her going crazy and eatting me.
My jimmy would never wake up if I saw her lmao, the flight mode would be activated 24/7 around that type.

**Brotherhood of the Wolf**

Keeping up with the french movie dive, the next movie that we would watch is about this mythical creature commiting crimes.
So far the movie is interesting and has a decent lineup of unique characters, but the racial undertones are also pretty crazy.

## 2023

- 9:00am - Looks like the feds took the whole market down a bit! Exciting to see how it will play out for the remaining week and even the rest of the year.
- 11:15am - Meeting before lunch, I think I am going to also take tomorrow off because I am tired and want to focus on Appwrite! I also have to create a whole new document for October, which I will bang out tomorrow mid-day as well.
- 3:16pm - Okay the general settings page looks good! I am going to push that out and see where I can go from there. Damn this is such a first world problem, I can not screen share at higher 4K, without it looking super buggy.
