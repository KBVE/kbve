### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Milestone

This is will be the official one year mark for our journal system!
Now I have to migrate the older entries into this vault, which might be a bit painful because I definitely missed some earlier entries.

I do need to find a way to atuoamtically pull in my tasks , but that will be a future holy problem.

#### Python

Let us open up the python stack and see what we can do!
First we want to make sure that the Dokcer build works as intended.

```shell

cd ~/github/kbve/apps/atlas
docker build -t exampleapp .

```

However I am thinking we could split the docker image and build process a bit more?
Maybe we make a `v01d` docker image and then use that as the base for what we want, hmm.

### 2023

<MDXJS>

#### Astro

-   I am running into weird issues with Astro 2.3.0, going to delay the upgrade until I can resolve them.

-   Started to make a Windows 11 template for the RSPS Project, but damn it seems to be a pain to get it all optimized and secure.

-   Should we keep raw daily notes? Or would it be too much information? Hmmm.

-   While I am in India, I just finished setting up my NR accounts, it feels interesting being a dual citizen. The idea that I can be on the other side of the world and live a completely different life style.

-   It was a bumper to see Starship flight get scrubbed.

-   Damn really had to put quotes on the title to avoid the YAML error.

The error is here:

```ini
7:18:30 PM: [astro:content-imports] can not read a block mapping entry; a multiline key may not be an implicit key
7:18:30 PM: file: /opt/build/repo/src/content/_bin/_daily.md?astroContent=true:4:4

7:18:30 PM:   Code:

7:18:30 PM:     > 4 | date: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
7:18:30 PM:         |    ^
7:18:30 PM:       5 | category: Daily

I had to wrap the title inside quotes to help with the mapping. >.>
