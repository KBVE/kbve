## 2024

**Shell**

I was working on this earlier yesterday night into the middle of the morning.
We want to move all the generic commands out of the cloud, so that `-nx` flag will run the commands without invoking the cloud credits.
I added a new command, `-nxc` that will run the commands with the cloud / cache instance, moving forward we can isolate the exact cases where we want to utilize the cloud.
One of the plans would be to automatically move the errors that get generated from the `-nxc` into a Github issue ticket and then let a couple different LLMs work on resolving the said issue.

**Groq**

Since we do not have the feather integration, I am thinking we can atleast throw in the groq integration.
The bigger issue would be to control the endpoint and have it not get abused by other 3rd party users.

**Music**

The next genre that we need to add is the study beats.
The base template for the studybeats genre will be under the `/docs/music/studybeats.mdx` and I will try to expand it out to about 10-20 songs for now.
We should explore all of `DeKobe` first, just grabbing some of his best work would be right move.

```shell

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=studybeats --title='DeKobe - Small Problems' --ytid=A0DHLDjQhaU"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=studybeats --title='DeKobe - Stars in the Forest' --ytid=XhhtsViFbfE"
./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:music --args="--file=chillstep --title='Fred again.. - Roze (Tiny Desk Version)' --ytid=48R8iCN4fN4"


```

## 2023

- 1:00am - Looking over the webmaster tools and seeing what I could to improve upon them! I am thinking of expanding the services that are provided and maybe include additional links? We know the goal for this tool is to include as much reference material as we can for all website owners, which does place us under a specific niche. The best bet would be not to over think it and slowly add more? I will keep researching and see if there could be some minor tweaks that I could do.
- 1:07am - Need to add `https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkbve.com%2F` into the WebMaster tool as a dev option? It would be interesting to have a small AI agent scope these out and then make suggestions! I guess another aspect would be to train the AI agent on a large amount of SEO/SEM data and then have it generate a custom report based upon the website added? Like a custom report generated for a generic amount too.
- 1:13am - I found another one that we could include in the dev report as well! `https://www.robtex.com/dns-lookup/kbve.com`, which is a decent chunk of information that a webmaster would be interested in. It does a solid job in looking through the DNS records. Speaking of looking through the records, I suppose we could also offer a free nmap search for the domain? This would be something that I could wrap all into an expansion issue / concept for the future of the webmaster tool.
- 1:29am - I completely forgot to add SEMRush as well, `https://semrush.com/info/kbve.com`, which should definitely be on the list as it is a vital SEO tool.
