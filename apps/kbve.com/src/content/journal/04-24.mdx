## 2024

**Edit**

Another amazing feature of starlight is that we can edit the documents right then and there!

All we had to do was update the starlight configuration and add in this:

```ts

editLink: {
				baseUrl: 'https://github.com/kbve/kbve/edit/dev/apps/kbve.com',
			},

```

**Theory**

After migrating over the applications, the next step would be to add our theory page!
However, I am thinking about the other sections too, but I do not want to get ahead of myself.

Lets us begin the theory migration!

## 2023

**India**

-   The day has been crazy! The heat is a killer. :O

**KBVE**

-   The main focus would be to get the GraphQL to work across the whole KBVE main page and then extend it to various applications.

-   It seems that we will have to use a mixture of GraphQL and REST, as there seems to be some areas where REST is faster.

## Notes

More Updates!
