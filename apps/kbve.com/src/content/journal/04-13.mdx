### 2024

#### Castle

My cousin just recent opened up their new home!
The cost for this house was close to a million for them to build but it is massive, interesting and feels like a little mansion.
The project was called the `Castle of Edison` by the developer, because of how high the ceilings are and the amount of open space that the house presents.

They were able to fit about 100 people in there and from the outside, you could not even tell there was anyone one.

#### War

The world seems to be just inches away from a global war. I do not have much to say about this feeling but it is looking closer towards becoming a dangerous eco-system across the different regions.

My fear is that it will escalate here within the southern regions of the Americas, once the threat is in our backyards, then the FUD is going to sky rocket.

#### DockerFile

The current plan is to split the Dockerfile for ATLAS to focus on building out the core functions, VNC, python 3.12, x11 , ect... then shift the setup to an `entrypoint.sh`.

In case anyone runs into an error like this: `ERROR: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

Open `Docker Desktop`, go to `Settings` > `Resources` > `WSL INTEGRATION` , then make sure that `Ubuntu` is selected. 

Incase we run into an issue where `Poetry` cannot be found, we can set the path for it within the `Dockerfile`:

```
# Ensure the Poetry bin directory is in the PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:${PATH}"
```

The amount of hours that I have spent going through different options and debugs! Ugh!

Next error on the dockerfile build:
