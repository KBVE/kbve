## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Phaser

The majority of this day will be preparing the game jam and making sure everyone is on board!
The VS Code live share does make it easier, to be honest. I think all software should be done in a duo.
Having a buddy while doing any type of software is a huge benefit, I think pair programming should be the future, add in an AI bot or two and now you have a full team.

#### JSON 

The JSON Map is what holds all the information for the tileset and editing the game/map data directly through the tileset editor, [Map Editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled?ac=MbLnMaiNXvG) and [Dev Tools](https://github.com/zewa666/grid-engine-devtools).

#### Vite

There is still an issue with the vite bundler and the pathing, which I still need to resolve for the `https://kbve.com/tools/travelbox` deployment!
The best move might be to deploy the assets using an absolute location from a s3 bucket.
