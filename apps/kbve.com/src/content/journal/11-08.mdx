    **TSLA**

    The run up past $300 is a huge problem for me!
    I am going to have to find a way to postpone the sell off of my 5 contracts, going to roll it into next week at 305 strike.
    Hopefully the post trump era stock cools off next week but this is a dangerous rally, it can easily skip to $400 without me even looking.

    **CryptoThrone**

    More updates to the crypto throne, including changing the tileset.
    We might have to go with a new way of handling the tilesets, I think if we switch out of the static and go with a dynamic?
