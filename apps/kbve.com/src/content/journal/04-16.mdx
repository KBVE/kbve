## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Charles

We are back online with Charles!
Yay! This has been a long time coming, almost since end of October that we would have an operational and self-hosted ML project.
A ton of effort has went into getting here, I can not wait to see where we go from this point.

The plan for charles right now is to setup the promox instance with the functional GPU passthroughs, ideally extending out the vGPUs.

#### Python

Updating the monorepo's python install to make sure it is `3.12` for now, I will try and prepare another update for `3.13` once all the other libraries are updated and ready.

#### k8s

The next move would be to prepare the `k8s` migration for our docker and docker swarm.
We will most likely use a `kre2` as our base kube framework, its a nice blend of upstream k8s and k3s but with security in mind.
