    3rd of April.
    In dat gentle embrace of the night, my dream wove a tapestry of April showers, where each raindrop whispered tales of renewal, hope and feelings of spiritual dope.
    As dawn's first light peeked through, the world outside mirrored my dream, painting everything with dat fresh, dewy promise of a new beginning.

## Tasks

-   [ ] -   Preparing Bun Docker Image.

</MDXJS>


<MDXJS>

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Tesla

The earnings for Tesla were terrible for the future of the company and its growth!
I actually think part of the reason behind the slow down in the growth cycle would be the higher interest rates and the general brand image of Elon.
While the fed could lower the rates, as they are already hinting at cutting the rates about three times this year, the brand image for Elon is going to be tough to repair.

Overall there has been no major shifts in the way we hold shares, I will try to poor man cover call them or push the strike price out as far as I can within reason.

If the company shares drop even to the low $100, we might actually switch to doing puts, because the value is there.

#### Apple

I am hoping that AAPL does spike back around to the mid $180s, but we might have to take a L and drop a couple hundred shares to fund our war chest!
This will be a bit tough to work out, considering the cost for the food truck and its operations are going be expensive for the first couple months.

</MDXJS>

<MDXJS>

#### N8N

The next plan for this weekend will be to setup another instance of n8n and then finally close out the `coolify` instance , as we will migrate everything into the swarm.
Once the swarm migration is complete, we can start to spin up the `k8s` cluster and begin our stateless adventures!

</MDXJS>

<MDXJS>

#### Bounty

The bounty system is next in the chopping block for the summer, I want to pool in around $10,000 - $20,000 for the bounty rewards, with the goal of making it easier to solve the problems within this monorepo.
I feel like once we get a couple new projects into this pipeline and have full featured functional products, aka FFF, rather than just basic MVPS, this would be the next logical step.
As more open source projects are coming to the market, we will have to find a way to reward the users that contribute to our repo.

#### PGP

The message system is still under works! The plan is to extend out the API table and include a new webhook table. 
Hmm, this part of the journal is a bit of a mess to keep on record.

#### Bun

When building out the bun docker image, we have to take a look at the current eco-system around it, i.e `websockets`, and make sure that final image is production ready.

Our notes for [Bun](https://kbve.com/application/javascript/) are inside of the Javascript section, incase you need a reference.

The official bun images are located [here at their docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun/tags) and for this test case we should take a look at their `distroless`.

It is under the tag of `docker pull oven/bun:distroless` but for the development cycle we might either use `1` or `1.1` as writing this.

The issue ticket of interest is [here](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/4836), which goes into the general structure of what we would want to do for our colyseus docker image.

#### API

To get started with adding the `API` route, lets make sure that the current rust build is fine locally, given the recent changes to the monorepo.

We will head over to the `project.json` for the `rust_api_profile` and see that the dev command is `run`, thus we will execute `./kbve.sh -nx rust_api_profile:run` and that should place the API on port 3000.
In this situation we want to make a new route, called `actions` and have it require that we pass the `API` token and followed by the path.

Under `actions`, we can create a sub-route called `n8n`, which will handle our `n8n`-based actions via the Rust API. Since we already have the tables created, we can have the path look up the ulid for the n8n webhook and then pass the information that is being sent over to it.

We already have an n8n instance up and running, so we can use that instance to help us manage our application.

While we do have an instance of n8n already running, this would be a good time to isolate the instances, with one being in development and the other in production.

```yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  n8n:
    hostname: n8n
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    container_name: n8n
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 1
      labels:
        # Base Traefik Labels
        - traefik.enable=true
        - traefik.constraint-label-stack=n8n
        - traefik.docker.network=public
        - traefik.http.services.n8n.loadbalancer.server.port=5678
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n.rule=Host(`automation.kbve.com`)
        # HTTP
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_http.entrypoints=web
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_http.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_http.service=n8n
        # HTTPS
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_https.entrypoints=websecure
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_https.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_https.service=n8n
        - traefik.http.routers.n8n_https.tls=true

    volumes:
      - 

    networks:
      - n8n
      - rust
      - public




networks:
  n8n:
    name: n8n
    driver: overlay
    attachable: true
  rust:
    external: true
  public:
    external: true

```

We can have the n8n public facing from the start but eventually we would want to proxy this out as a subfolder? Hmm.
