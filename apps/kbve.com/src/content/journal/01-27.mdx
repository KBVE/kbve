## Notes

    #### keys

        Need to keep track of these keys:
            -   `portainer_stack`
            -   `jwt_secret`
            -   `portainer`
            -   `hcaptcha`
            -   `kbve`
            -   `shieldwall`
    
    #### Hosts

        Need to extend the hosts table.

### 2024

    -   11:30am -   `Schema`

        #### Schema

            Starting off the weekend with more schema changes!
            Finalize the message table and then expand out the host table, but before doing those two tables, I need to make sure the global keys are added.
            It seems that during the `dbmodels.rs` generation under the `erust` folder, the struct derives seem to fail, thus I need to see why it fails.
            The original shell uses sed to replace `(Queryable, Debug, Identifiable)` but since we shifted the primarykey back to serial / big int instead of binary, we no longer need the `Identfiable`!
            Thus going to remove that aspect of the schema generation.
            
            In addition, there would be the zod that we need to expand.

                ```javascript

                    export const registerUserSchema = z.object({
                        username: z.string(),
                        email: z.string(),
                        password: z.string(),
                        confirmPassword: z.string(),
                        });

                        export function registerUserSchemaValidation(schema: ZodRawShape) {
                        return registerUserSchema
                            .extend(schema)
                            .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
                            message: "Passwords do not match",
                            path: ["confirmPassword"],
                            })
                            .refine((data) => /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(data.username) && data.username.length >= 3 && data.username.length <= 20, {
                            message: "Username must be 3-20 characters long and only contain alphanumeric characters",
                            path: ["username"],
                            });
                    }

                ```
            
            This is an example of the zod expansion, which is through the `extend` and `refine` functions of the zod's `ZodRawShape` object.
