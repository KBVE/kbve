        Need to keep track of these keys:
            -   `portainer_stack` - Added
            -   `jwt_secret` - Added
            -   `portainer` - Added
            -   `hcaptcha` - Added
            -   `kbve` - Added
            -   `shieldwall` - Added
    
    #### Hosts

        Need to extend the hosts table.

### 2024

    -   11:30am -   `Schema`

        #### Schema

            Starting off the weekend with more schema changes!
            Finalize the message table and then expand out the host table, but before doing those two tables, I need to make sure the global keys are added.
            It seems that during the `dbmodels.rs` generation under the `erust` folder, the struct derives seem to fail, thus I need to see why it fails.
            The original shell uses sed to replace `(Queryable, Debug, Identifiable)` but since we shifted the primarykey back to serial / big int instead of binary, we no longer need the `Identfiable`!
            Thus going to remove that aspect of the schema generation.
            
            In addition, there would be the zod that we need to expand.

                ```javascript

                    export const registerUserSchema = z.object({
                        username: z.string(),
                        email: z.string(),
                        password: z.string(),
                        confirmPassword: z.string(),
                        });

                        export function registerUserSchemaValidation(schema: ZodRawShape) {
                        return registerUserSchema
                            .extend(schema)
                            .refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
                            message: "Passwords do not match",
                            path: ["confirmPassword"],
                            })
                            .refine((data) => /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(data.username) && data.username.length >= 3 && data.username.length <= 20, {
                            message: "Username must be 3-20 characters long and only contain alphanumeric characters",
                            path: ["username"],
                            });
                    }

                ```
            
            This is an example of the zod expansion, which is through the `extend` and `refine` functions of the zod's `ZodRawShape` object.
            
    -   3:40pm -    `Refactor`

        #### Refactor

            The worst feeling about refactoring is knowning that you have to do it a couple times over and over.
            Even this current refactor that I am doing right now, sadly will be done again using SQLX instead of Diesel, which is a pain to think about down the line.
            The main reason we would be doing the refactor again, even if we are refactoring it right now is because of the C library that Diesel depends on for MySQL.


    -   11:40pm -   `Drizzle`

        #### Drizzle

            When updating Drizzle within the monorepo, we run three commands.
            The first command, aka `./kbve.sh -atomic drizzle kit upgrade`, would be to create a new branch for the upgrade, just to make sure that nothing breaks!
            The second command is `pnpm add drizzle-kit@latest -D` and finally the third command is `./kbve.sh -reset`.
            Finally, let us test case the studio by running `./kbve.sh -studio`.

            Inside of the studio, we want to add the seven global keys that we wiped earlier, which I placed under notes as keys.
