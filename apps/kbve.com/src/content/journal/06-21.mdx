**Atlas**

Going to update the `i-atlas-process.yml` by removing the initial checkout for the first couple actions, as we do not need the whole monorepo.

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

This step within the job is not needed, so we can remove that for the time being.

Okay we were able to get the comment to be placed onto the issue ticket and resolved the npm library issue that we were facing earlier.
Now there will be a couple steps that we need to execute, it will be kind of like putting together a puzzle set.
We already know that the pieces are functional but the orchestration has be secure, ensuring that there are not leaks or mismanagement amoung the different steps.

In our first stage, the focus will be on only two actions that we want to execute, the `atlas_action` and the `music_action`.
Once we get these resolved, we can move forward with the `herbmail_action` and `rareicon_action`.
Granted we are very much behind schedule, maybe we can try to force some concepts through this weekend and get back on track.

I just spotted a quick error, inside of this action script block:

```yaml

      - name: Check title of the ticket
        id: title-parser
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const { _$gha_kbve_ActionProcess } = require('@kbve/devops');
            const title = context.payload.issue.title;
            try {
              const action = _$gha_kbve_ActionProcess(title);
              core.setOutput('action', action);
            } catch (error) {
              core.setFailed(`Error processing title: ${error.message}`);
            }

```

We need to wrap the `_$gha_` action within a try-catch, because it will throw an error.

**mL**

Just a minor shift in the mL docs, there is a decent amount of information and links that are missing from the whole document, but I think I will take a couple stabs at it slowly.
We should have a jupyter notebook section and it would be really interesting to have atlas open them up and execute commands against them?
Now I am really running the gears in my mind.

**Prompt**

Need to test out the prompt engine and make sure the devops library can grab the different prompts, based upon their ULIDs.

## 2023

- 8:30am - It seems that I was assigned again on a SPY put, so forced to buy 100 shares of $SPY. I might also get assigned on one of my TSLA calls, but at the same time, my puts look like they expired with a decent amount of profit. Overall this week looks like another $2000 in the bag, which I will most likely allocate towards CEFs, as my REIT position is already above 10% of my portfolio. I might also look into adding a larger position of bonds too, including some meme bonds.
- 5:00pm - Decided to delete the older manga reference files, including the abstract theme. I am going to start it again but with a fresh take and maybe a more internal / core approach to resolve the issue. As for the transition effects, we could reference the older SWUP but we can also utilize the pre-fetch to help load the options before hand? There are a couple ways we could go about this.
- 11:00pm - It looks like the basic layout for the manga / visual novel looks like it can be a MVP. I am going to mess around with the settings and see if we can expand upon that.
