## Notes

### 2024

<MDXJS>

#### Bathroom

The upstair bathroom is almost done! Yay!
I can not wait to get back into my normal flow and having decently warm water again.

#### Expo BBQ

I will try to build out the components with minor changes here and there.

I am thinking the color choice and abstraction should be built into the components, but I am not too sure yet.

#### State

Nothing makes me enjoy my morning coffee, like thinking about state management!
Once I get a bit more work done in the client side, I will most definitely look into building the final client-side state management library, which I want to use every where! Muahaha.

#### BBQEmbed

The BBQ Embed will handle the WebView and Iframe embeds!

We created the `BBQEmbed.tsx` within the `expo-bbq` and now we want to go ahead and render it within the `lcagents` app.

```js

<BBQEmbed src="https://kbve.com/arcade/itch" />

```

</MDXJS>

#### GahAction

Time to do some of the classic github actions! GaHActions baby

Action to run the serve -> `pnpm nx serve expo-lcagents`
Now I am going to assume the build might require some work!

We will look into the publish websites with Metro, here is how we can go about doing that, [document for reference](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/publishing-websites/).

Okay! To build out the website, we run this command: `./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:export`, which exports out to `dist/apps/expo-lcagents/` and we can then make it deploy to the LC-Agents repo.
