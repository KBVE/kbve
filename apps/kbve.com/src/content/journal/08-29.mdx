## 2024

**Train**

Leaving Rome once more, its been almost a decade since I was last here.
Next time I am going to come here with a bunch of helper notes.
A world wide scavengar hunt is also a cool idea for promoting Rent Earth.

**Postgres**

We could split the global key value storage but I think it might be fine to just use it within the postgres database.
Having it stored and saved at a core level within the postgres but then being pulled out and into redis would just save us time in the long term.

**Florence**
We are about to arrive in my favorite city in the world!
Well, Rome is not bad at all, I do believe it holds a great place in my heart, there is just something about Flora.
Maybe a trip to Siena next? 
Hmm, that is making me wonder if its worth the time investment to plan around a quick day trip.
Actually this would mean that working remotely and traveling around Italy for short bursts is possible without any major pain points.
Now I just need to find a girlfriend that can the same with me, ideally another software engineer and we would be set.

## 2023

- 9:13am - Getting ready for the markets to open up, but before I do that, I should make sure everything is in sync. I will publish out this branch really quick before going a bit deeper into the deployments.

- 12:40pm - It seems that everyone at work was pleased with the backup plan and writeup that I did, I played deeper into the "Trump" style presentation, keeping to simple and short words that got the point across. I r regarded.

- 5:15pm - I am currently doing a bit of R&D on the different paths we could take for the file system management, which would also include the backup storage and the restoration. While my documentation can provide a decent roadmap for where we want to go, I think sometimes the time spent mapping out should not be overloaded because there will always be interesting and unique edge cases that will take a large chunk of time out of the implementation. This is just really a note to my future self on how to tackle those issues.
