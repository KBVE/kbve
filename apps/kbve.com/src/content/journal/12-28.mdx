    **RPI**

    This is the first journal entry from the RPI!
    We were not able to get it working through the elemental os but I think that might be because there just is not enough documentation on it for now?
    Regardless, I think it might just be better to run ubuntu for on the RPI and maybe try to do the `k2d` or some other `edge` setup.
    I will put more notes down for this situation later today.

    **Unity**

    Going to spend the next couple hours going through Unity and seeing what changes that I have to do tonight.
    I believe we last left off with the discord integration and the AStar pathing.
    First error with the JavascriptFFI, seems that there was a duplicate function name, so I am going to adjust for that next.
