## 2024

**Kilobase**

The task that has been waiting for a while, geting the redis extension working again within our postgres instance!
We would have to split this up into a couple different parts, ugh, I hate having to run the docker desktop, it makes everything more painful.
Let me make sure that the cluster is operational, which I can do via the cli through this command: `kubectl get pods -n supabase` and then we can wait the decade, err, the 10mins, for docker desktop to boot up.


**Feels**

The unity engine component that we want focus on will be the Feels component, specifically their `MMSoundManager`.
Now this is where we get into a bit of a tricky mess because we do not know if the extension will be installed in every future project.
The solution would be to create a collection of custom scripting symbols that are specific to the different plugins, extensions and namespaces.
I am also thinking that we would need to isolate those specific extensions into sub-folders, `KBVE.Kilonet.MM` would hold all the `MoreMountains` instances, while `KBVE.Kilonet.Vuplex` would hold the vuplex code?
This approach would make more the most sense for now.

**CryptoThrone**

The next major update for the CryptoThrone.com game will be to include a register and login system for the player.
We will integrate directly to our supabase instance and use this as another example to test case our self hosted instance.
After we migrate this website, we can loop back around and migrate any of the additional domains that we are hosting or managing?
Herbmail does need a whole new UI/UX upgrade and so does RareIcon, hmm, we can do those two afterwards.
As for the HQPlan and the Cityvote, we will hold off on those while doing the docker desktop build because expo will take up too much time and resources.
