## DRAFT / OUTLINE

## SolarPunk

`Solarpunk` is a relatively new subgenre of science fiction and speculative fiction that imagines a future society based on renewable energy and sustainable practices; the term `solarpunk` was coined in 21st century by a group of science fiction writers and fans who were looking for a more optimistic and hopeful vision of the future, as opposed to the often dystopian themes found in other forms of science fiction.

Solarpunk stories and artwork often feature lush greenery, vibrant colors, and a focus on community and cooperation. Technology is still present, but it is powered by clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and designed to work in harmony with nature.

Some of the key themes of solarpunk include environmentalism, social justice, and the rejection of consumerism and materialism. The goal of solarpunk is to inspire people to imagine and create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

The solarpunk movement aims to inspire and promote real-world solutions for creating a sustainable and just future. In short, the theory of solarpunk is a hopeful and optimistic vision of the future that challenges us to imagine and create a more sustainable and just world. It encourages us to think creatively and collaboratively, and to take action to create the future we want to see.

## Focus on Renewable Energy

With energy being an important pillar and foundation of the theory, Solarpunk imagines a future world where society is powered by renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, rather than fossil fuels. This means that buildings, vehicles, and other technologies are designed to be energy-efficient, sustainable and prosperous.

Renewable energy is a central focus of solarpunk, as it is seen as a key solution to the environmental and social issues facing our world today.
Furthermore, the theory represents a fundamental shift away from the destructive and unsustainable practices of the past, and towards a more sustainable and equitable future. Thus, by promoting, investing and expanding renewable energy sources, the theory of solarpunk seeks to create a more hopeful and optimistic vision of the future, where human society can thrive in harmony with the natural world.

### Energy Independence

Solarpunk also aims to create a more decentralized and democratic energy system.
By promoting the use of rooftop solar panels, community-owned wind turbines, and other forms of distributed energy generation, solarpunk seeks to reduce our dependence on centralized fossil fuel power plants and create a more resilient and flexible energy system.

## Connection to Nature

Solarpunk emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with nature.
This means incorporating natural elements like greenery and water into urban design, and designing technology to work with, rather than against, the environment.
Solarpunk encourages people to spend time outdoors and connect with nature.
This can include initiatives like creating urban green spaces, promoting outdoor recreation, and encouraging people to spend time in natural environments.

### Climate Change Mitigation

One of the primary goals of solarpunk is to mitigate the effects of climate change.
By promoting the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, solarpunk seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change.

## Community and Cooperation

In a solarpunk world, people work together to create sustainable systems and infrastructure. This means that there is a strong emphasis on community and cooperation, rather than individualism and competition.

## Social Justice

Solarpunk recognizes that environmental issues are intertwined with social issues like poverty and inequality. Therefore, solarpunk aims to create a more just and equitable society, where everyone has access to clean energy, clean water, and other basic necessities.

### Access to Energy

Solarpunk recognizes that access to energy is a basic human right.
By promoting the use of renewable energy sources, solarpunk seeks to create a more equitable energy system where everyone has access to clean and affordable energy.

## Rejection of Consumerism and Materialism

Solarpunk challenges the idea that material possessions and consumption are the keys to happiness and fulfillment. Instead, solarpunk promotes a simpler, more sustainable lifestyle that focuses on experiences and relationships rather than possessions.

## Innovation and Creativity

Solarpunk encourages innovation and creativity in the development of renewable energy technologies. By imagining new and creative ways to harness renewable energy, solarpunk seeks to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system.

## Biophilic Design

Solarpunk promotes the use of biophilic design, which incorporates natural elements like greenery, natural light, and water into urban design.
Biophilic design has been shown to improve human health and well-being, and also provides habitat for wildlife.
Biophilic design is a design approach that seeks to incorporate natural elements and patterns into built environments in order to create a more harmonious and restorative relationship between people and nature.
The term "biophilia" was coined by the biologist E.O. Wilson to describe the innate human tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life.

### Natural Materials

Biophilic design incorporates natural materials like wood, stone, and clay, which have a natural and organic feel. These materials can be used for building facades, interior finishes, and furniture.

Example of natural material usage within biophilic would be the tradition of tree shaping.

### Natural Light

The design style seeks to maximize the use of natural light in built environments, which has been shown to have numerous health benefits. This can include designing buildings to maximize daylight, using skylights and light wells, and using reflective surfaces to bounce light deeper into interior spaces.
Furthermore, incorporating views of nature into built environments has been shown to reduce stress and improve cognitive function. This can include designing buildings to offer views of natural landscapes, or creating green walls and roofs to bring nature indoors.

### Hydroponics

Landscape design often incorporates water features like fountains and ponds, which can have a calming effect and improve air quality. This is taken a step further by recylcing the grey waste water into a hydroponic instance, thus creating an indoor

## Sustainable Agriculture

> Solarpunk recognizes that our food system is intimately connected to the health of the environment. Therefore, solarpunk promotes sustainable agriculture practices like regenerative farming, agroforestry, and permaculture, which work with the natural ecosystem rather than against it.
> Sustainable agriculture is an approach to food production that seeks to balance economic, social, and environmental factors in a way that promotes long-term sustainability. Sustainable agriculture practices prioritize the health and well-being of the natural ecosystem, while also providing for the needs of people.

### Regenerative Farming

Regenerative farming practices aim to restore and improve the health of the soil. This can include practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, and reduced tillage, which help to build soil health, reduce erosion, and improve water quality.

### Agroforestry

Agroforestry acknowledges the importance of trees in food production systems. Therefore, agroforestry practices like integrating trees into crop fields or planting orchards can provide numerous benefits, including soil stabilization, increased biodiversity, and improved carbon sequestration.

### Permaculture

Permaculture incorporates permaculture principles, which aim to design food production systems that mimic natural ecosystems. Permaculture practices can include companion planting, mulching, and using natural pest control methods.

### Localized Food Systems

The idea of local food systems, which can reduce the environmental impacts of food transportation, support local economies, and increase access to fresh, healthy food.

### Biodiversity

> Importance of biodiversity in maintaining healthy ecosystems. Therefore, sustainable agriculture practices prioritize the preservation and promotion of biodiversity in food production systems.

#### Genetic Diversity

> Biodiversity plays an essential role in maintaining the genetic diversity of crops and livestock. This diversity helps to ensure that agriculture is resilient to changes in climate, pests, and diseases, and that farmers have a wide range of options to choose from when selecting crops or animals that are best adapted to their specific conditions. Genetic diversity can also improve the quality of crops and livestock, such as by enhancing nutritional value or increasing yield

#### Ecosystem Services

> Biodiversity is crucial in providing ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, soil health, and water filtration. Pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and birds, are essential for the reproduction of many crops, and the loss of these species could have severe impacts on food production. Similarly, natural predators can help control pests that would otherwise damage crops. Soil organisms such as worms and microbes help to maintain soil fertility and structure, which is vital for healthy plant growth.

#### Resilience and Adaptability

> Biodiversity provides resilience and adaptability to ecosystems and agricultural systems. A diverse range of crops and livestock reduces the risk of crop failure and animal disease outbreaks, which can devastate livelihoods and threaten food security. Diverse ecosystems are better able to adapt to changes such as climate change, drought, or flooding.

#### Cultural Significance

> Biodiversity is often intertwined with cultural practices and traditional knowledge. Many communities rely on specific plant or animal species for food, medicine, or cultural practices, and the loss of these species can have severe social and cultural impacts.
