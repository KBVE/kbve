## Information.

Virtualization soft scripting for automation.

v01d is a powerful virtualization software designed to streamline automation through soft scripting.
It enables developers and IT administrators to easily create, manage, and orchestrate virtual environments without the need for complex configurations.
With support for various hypervisors and cloud platforms, v01d simplifies the deployment and scaling of virtual machines and containers.
The software's scripting capabilities offer fine-grained control over automation workflows, making it ideal for both small-scale testing and large-scale production setups.
By leveraging v01d, teams can reduce overhead and enhance operational efficiency across their virtualized infrastructure.

## VOID

-   Virtualized Object Intelligence Daemon, or VOID, is an operator application that manages servers, nested machines and clustered instances within an eco-system.

    -   Linux

        -   `void_install_ubuntu.sh` - (chmod 777) - Installation for Ubuntu 18+
        -   `void_install_debian.sh` - (chmod 777) - Installation for Debian 9+

    -   Windows

        -   `void_install_win11.exe` - (admin privilege) - Install for Windows 11

    -   Mac
        -   Mac M1 / M2\* has an ARM based system, so it might have to be isolated from the intel macs.
        -   Expanding upon brew might be a better course for Macs\*

-   Environs are entities that help balance and regulate the digital environmental.

## TR33

-   `tr33` - (environ) - a collection of timers that handle micro tasks on the host machine.
    -   `tr33._04` - v4 is stable for Ubuntu 22 LTS, Debian 9, Windows 10/11.
        -   `tr33._04.nginx.1_22` - Nginx
        -   `tr33._04.apache.1` - Disabled.
    -   `tr33._05YAML_.` - v5 is unstable but utilizes YAML, slated for deprecation by Q3 of 2024.
    -   `tr33._06JSON_.` - v6 is unstable but utilizes a JSON-based API for commands, slated for deprecation by Q4 of 2025.0
    -   `tr33._01` - Deprecated - A rootkit that was designed and based upon various viruses.
    -   `tr33._02` - Deprecated.
    -   `tr33._03` - Deprecated.

## S33D

-   `s33d` - (environ) - an application or library that expands upon torrent data seeding.
    -   `s33d._dna.` - commands that the host computer must run to enable specific future applications.
        -   `s33d._dna.WebRTC.1_3` - Enables WebRTC.
    -   `s33d._nfc.` - Compressed information that can be stored inside NFC. The format will take about 64 bytes.
        -   `68 74 74 70 73 3a 2f 2f 6e 2e 6b 62 76 65 2e 63 6f 6d 2f 64 6e 61 2f` - 23 bytes for the generic/default location of the seed, with 40 bytes left over for additional information regarding the application(s).

## BL0CK

-   `bl0ck` - micro storage for host.
    -   `bl0ck.B64AES.` - Based 64 - AES compressed data block.
    -   `bl0ck.chain._` - Micro blockchain for the void system(s).

## R00T

-   `r00t` - (environ) - an embed that sits on-top of the operating system.
    -   `r00t` - Disabled as of `tr33._02` because the design induced significant flaws and exploits; uncle ben does not approve of such power for any man.
