## Cheatsheet

### MySQL/MariaDB Cheatsheet

-   Admin Commands

    -   Drop Database (Be extremely careful when running this)

        -   ```sql
            DROP DATABASE {$db_name};
            ```
            -   Replace `{$db_Name}` with the database that you wish to DROP.
            -   _Remember that all the data will be removed and can not be recovered._

    -   List All Users

        -   ```sql
            SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
            ```
            -   This will display all the users within the database instance.

    -   Create User

        -   ```sql
            CREATE USER {$user[@'host']} IDENTIFIED BY 'plain-text-password';
            ```
            -   `{$user[@'host']}` can be replaced by an example like this `'root'@'localhost'` or `'root'@'10.%.%.%'`
                -   `10.%.%.%` - The `%` is a wildcard for the IP Address subnet.

    -   Drop User

        -   ```sql
            DROP USER {$user[@'host']}
            ```
            -   This will only remove the user from the mysql instance.

    -   Create Database

        -   ```sql
            CREATE DATABASE {$database_name}
            ```
            -   `{$database_name}` can be replaced as `database_name_example` , thus creating a statement like `CREATE DATABASE database_name_example`.

    -   Grant permissions / privilegages.
        -   ```sql
            GRANT ALL ON ${database_name}.* TO {$user[@'host']}
            ```
            -   There are a couple situations that this statement creates, first it gives `ALL` permissions to the database, `${database_name}` with the `.*` being a wildcard for all the tables inside of the database. Finally the `{$user[@'host']}` represents the user connecting via the IP Address.

### CNPG

CloudNativePG, aka CNPG, is an open-source Kubernetes operator designed to manage PostgreSQL clusters natively within Kubernetes environments.
It supports the entire lifecycle of a PostgreSQL cluster, from initial deployment to ongoing maintenance, with built-in features like automated failover, scaling of read replicas, and rolling updates.
CloudNativePG leverages native PostgreSQL streaming replication to provide high availability and disaster recovery options.
It integrates directly with the Kubernetes API server, eliminating the need for external failover management tools.
Additionally, it supports common PostgreSQL extensions and offers monitoring capabilities through Prometheus integration.
This operator is tailored to modern cloud-native architecture and is ideal for PostgreSQL deployments that require seamless management within Kubernetes.

#### CNPG Image Requirements

The CloudNativePG operator for Kubernetes requires that certain PostgreSQL executables and tools be present within the container image during the image build process.
These requirements are essential for the operator to automate the management of PostgreSQL clusters, including initialization, backups, and restoration.
Without these components, the operator will not be able to perform tasks such as setting up the database, handling replication, or managing cloud-based backup solutions like Barman.
Additionally, if audit logging is required, the pgaudit extension should be installed as part of the container image build.

1. PostgreSQL Executables in Path:

- `initdb`
- `postgres`
- `pg_ctl`
- `pg_controldata`
- `pg_basebackup`

2. Barman Cloud Executables in Path (for integration with cloud storage):

- `barman-cloud-backup`
- `barman-cloud-backup-delete`
- `barman-cloud-backup-list`
- `barman-cloud-check-wal-archive`
- `barman-cloud-restore`
- `barman-cloud-wal-archive`
- `barman-cloud-wal-restore`

3. Optional PostgreSQL Extensions:

- `PGAudit` - The pgaudit extension should be pre-installed in the image if audit logging is required within the deployed PostgreSQL clusters.

4. Locale Settings:

- Ensure that appropriate locale settings are configured to support the desired language and encoding for the PostgreSQL database.


These requirements ensure compatibility and proper functionality of CloudNativePG with various PostgreSQL features, including cloud-based backup and restoration via Barman Cloud, as well as extended audit capabilities through PGAudit.

#### CNPG Deployment Example

Here is a quick base example of the bootstrap initdb that we are using to start our cluster.

```yaml

bootstrap:
    initdb:
        database: app
        owner: app
        dataChecksums: true
        encoding: 'UTF8'
        postInitApplicationSQLRefs:
            configMapRefs:
                -   name: {{ include "supabase.db.fullname" . }}-init
                    key: configmap.sql
                -   name: {{ include "supabase.db.fullname" . }}-sql
                    key: alt.sql
        postInitApplicationSQL:
            - "ALTER DATABASE postgres SET \"app.settings.jwt_secret\" TO '{{ .Values.secret.jwt.secretRefKey.secret }}';"
            - "ALTER DATABASE postgres SET \"app.settings.jwt_exp\" TO '3600';"


```

#### CNPG Recovery Example

Here is our CNPG recovery example using AWS for our self hosted supabase instance.
It should be noted that the new cluster should not share some the same variables like `name` because it might cause some errors with the new cluster's WAL.

```yaml

bootstrap:
    recovery:
        source: supabase

externalClusters:
    - name: supabase
      barmanObjectStore:
        serverName: supabase
        destinationPath: s3://kilobase/barman/restore/
        s3Credentials:
          accessKeyId:
            name: {{ .Values.secret.s3.secretRef }}
            key: {{ .Values.secret.s3.secretRefKey.keyId | quote }}
          secretAccessKey:
            name: {{ .Values.secret.s3.secretRef }}
            key: {{ .Values.secret.s3.secretRefKey.accessKey | quote }}
        wal:
          compression: gzip

```

---

#### CNPG Backup Example

There are two types of backups that we can utilize, the `Kind: Backup` and `Kind: ScheduledBackup`, both will store the postgres data into the barman object store in these examples.
Below is the `cnpg-cluster-backup.yaml` that we added for our self hosted supabase cluster.
The current `schedule: "0 0 0 * * 0"` is set for weekly backups but that can be easily adjusted for daily.

```yaml 

apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: {{ include "supabase.db.fullname" . }}-backup
spec:
  method: barmanObjectStore
  cluster:
    name: {{ include "supabase.db.fullname" . }}

---
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: ScheduledBackup
metadata:
  name: {{ include "supabase.db.fullname" . }}-bk-job
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 0 * * 0"
  backupOwnerReference: self
  cluster:
    name: {{ include "supabase.db.fullname" . }}

```

<Aside>

Remember to test case the recovery of the backups using a secondary cluster deployment and becareful of the WAL locations, to avoid an overwrite.

### Barman


Barman (Backup and Recovery Manager) is an advanced backup and recovery solution designed specifically for PostgreSQL databases.
It allows database administrators to automate backup processes, perform disaster recovery, and maintain business continuity by ensuring that data is always recoverable.
Barman can be installed using Python’s package manager (pip) or through PostgreSQL’s official PPA (Personal Package Archive), making it easy to set up and integrate into existing infrastructures.
Once installed, Barman provides a command-line interface (barman-cli) that supports managing backups, restoring databases, monitoring replication, and verifying the integrity of stored data.
One of its key features is Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR), which enables the restoration of a database to a specific moment, even down to the second, providing a flexible approach for handling data inconsistencies or unintentional deletions.
Barman also supports parallel streaming and synchronous WAL (Write-Ahead Log) archiving, ensuring that backups remain up-to-date with minimal performance impact on the source database.
Additionally, Barman offers monitoring capabilities with built-in commands for checking the status of backups, space utilization, and replication delays, enabling proactive maintenance and alerts.
For cloud deployments, Barman Cloud CLI extends its capabilities by offering integration with cloud storage providers such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage, making it a versatile solution for hybrid and cloud-native environments.
With the Barman Cloud CLI, you can seamlessly configure cloud storage, perform backups, restore operations, and leverage cloud-based encryption for an added layer of data security.
Overall, Barman and its cloud extension provide a comprehensive toolkit for database administrators to manage the complexities of PostgreSQL backups, ensuring data is securely stored, quickly recoverable, and effectively managed both on-premises and in the cloud.

<Aside>

💡 Reminder: Always test your Barman backup and recovery setup in a non-production environment before a real disaster occurs.
Running recovery simulations ensures that your backups are correctly configured and that the recovery process works as expected, giving you confidence that your data is safe and recoverable.
Regular testing is crucial to avoid unexpected failures during critical moments.

</Aside>

We want the barman to be installed directly into our postgres image and thus we will add a stage called `Barman`.
Here is a brief example of us setting up the barman cloud cli inside of our `kilobase` image that is based upon the supabase image.

```Dockerfile

# Install necessary utilities like wget and gnupg before adding the PostgreSQL PPA
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    gnupg \
    wget \
    ca-certificates && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Add the PostgreSQL PPA and import the key
RUN sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ focal-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list' && \
    wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | apt-key add -

# Update and install barman-cli-cloud from the PostgreSQL PPA
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    barman-cli-cloud

# Clean up unnecessary files to reduce image size
RUN apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

```
