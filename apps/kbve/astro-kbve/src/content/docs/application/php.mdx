## Information

PHP is a [programming](/theory/programming/) language known as Hypertext Preprocessor, originally standing for Personal Home Page. 
It is widely used for web development, famed for its ease of use and ability to be embedded directly into HTML. 
PHP is dynamic and server-side, allowing developers to build robust web applications that can handle complex data-driven tasks.

PHP supports a wide range of databases, has rich built-in functions, and can interact with various web services. 
It's also part of the classic LAMP ([Linux](/application/linux/), Apache, [MySQL](/application/sql/), PHP) stack which powers countless servers across the globe.
PHP continues to evolve with regular updates that improve its performance, security features, and modern language capabilities.
