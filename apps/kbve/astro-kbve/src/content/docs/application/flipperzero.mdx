## Firmware

> The bundles of joy when installing various firmware for your flipperzero!
> The main chipset on the FlipperZero stores both a "New" and "Old" firmware, thus making it a bit easier to custom load your firmware without the higher risk of bricking your device. Granted there is always a risk of bricking your device, so be very careful! Make sure wires are tight and your machine is charged.

Firmware is the software that powers your Flipper Zero and lets you enjoy its amazing capabilities and control its functions and features.
We will teach you how to update your firmware, thus keeping your device fresh and flawless with new improvements and fixes.
There are different types of firmware for Flipper Zero, such as the official firmware, the release candidate firmware, the dev firmware, and the custom firmwares.
The official firmware is the stable version that is tested and approved by the Flipper team.
The release candidate firmware is the next version that is being tested before it becomes official.
Finally the dev firmware is the latest version that has new features and changes, but it may have bugs and errors.
In addition, there are custom firmwares made by other users who want to modify or add something to the Flipper Zero, which we will go over later down in this document.
You can choose which firmware you want to use and install it using the Flipper Mobile App or the qFlipper desktop application, with more information in the #update section.

### Custom

Custom firmwares are special versions of software that let you customize your Flipper Zero and unlock new possibilities.
They are made by creative and talented users who want to share their ideas and innovations with the Flipper community.
You can try different custom firmwares and see what they can do for your device!
We hope you find the best custom firmware to fit your needs and we recommend having multiple SD Cards with each custom firmware, so you can swap easily.

## Update

Once you get your hands on the flipperzero, we recommend that you update it to the latest firmware via qFlipper application, links below:

[Official Main](https://flipperzero.one/update) Updates
Github Repo Updates - [Release Page](https://github.com/flipperdevices/qFlipper/releases)

There are other methods of updating, including Mobile and Web but from experience, I recommend sticking with a direct cable upgrade, to avoid possible firmware corruption.
