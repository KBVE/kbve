description: |
    Android is an open source operating system based off of Linux that runs within the ARM architecture;
    the primary use case is within the mobile/tablet eco-system but it has been expanding into server, desktop and embedables.
    Android utilizes a modified Linux kernel optimized for low power devices and real time performance.
    Furthermore, the system provides a robust framework for application development through the Android SDK and Java/Kotlin APIs.
    Android's modular architecture allows hardware vendors to customize drivers, UI layers, and services for specific devices.
    With the introduction of Project Treble and mainline updates, the OS now supports more consistent long-term maintenance and faster security patches.
    Beyond consumer devices, Android has also evolved into specialized distributions such as Android TV, Android Auto, and Wear OS, extending its ecosystem across multiple platforms.

## Cheatsheet

The ADB cheat sheet is an essential resource for navigating and managing Android operating systems and applications via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).
It offers a comprehensive list of basic commands that facilitate various tasks such as installing apps, debugging issues, and accessing device logs.
While the cheat sheet covers a wide range of functionalities, it's important to note that some commands require root access, and certain Android versions may necessitate specific tweaks to the standard commands.
This makes the cheat sheet a versatile and indispensable tool for both novice users and experienced developers working with Android devices.

### Device Commands

Android ADB Device commands are commands that you can use to control the Android device over USB from a computer.
You can use them to list all devices, restart the ADB server, and reboot connected devices.

| Command            | Description                                                                | Notes / Variants                                                               |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `adb devices`      | List all connected devices.                                                |                                                                                |
| `adb devices -l`   | Query additional information (model, product, transport ID).               | Useful for identifying multiple devices.                                       |
| `adb get-state`    | Display the current device state (`device`, `offline`, or `unauthorized`). |                                                                                |
| `adb get-serialno` | Query the device’s serial number.                                          |                                                                                |
| `adb root`         | Launch the ADB daemon (`adbd`) with root permissions.                      | May fail on production builds: `adbd cannot run as root in production builds`. |
| `adb start-server` | Start the ADB server daemon.                                               | Runs automatically if missing when using other ADB commands.                   |
| `adb kill-server`  | Terminate the ADB server process.                                          | Use to restart ADB cleanly if it becomes unresponsive.                         |
| `adb reboot`       | Reboot the currently connected device.                                     | Accepts optional args like `bootloader` or `recovery`.                         |
| `adb help`         | Display general help and usage information.                                | Lists all supported subcommands.                                               |

### Shell

<Aside type="danger">

> Warning: Shell commands can brick your operating system, so make sure to double check them before running.

</Aside>

ADB shell is a command-line interface that you can use to access the shell and run various commands on your Android device.
You can use ADB shell commands to perform actions such as changing the resolution of your device display, uninstalling bloatware or system apps, enabling and disabling features, modifying the system files, ect..

<Aside type="note">

> Remember to keep a backup of the commands that you run via shell, I recommend creating a `log.txt` file and output all the commands to that file.

## Android Data Storage

In Android, there are several ways to store data persistently.
The choice of storage mechanism depends on the nature of the data and the requirements of the app.
Below are the primary methods for data storage in Android:

**Comparison of Storage Options**

| Storage Method    | Visibility | Persistence            | Complexity  | Best For                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SharedPreferences | Private    | Until app uninstall    | Low         | Small key-value pairs                    |
| Internal Storage  | Private    | Until app uninstall    | Low         | Private files                            |
| External Storage  | Public     | Until manually deleted | Medium      | Large/shared files                       |
| SQLite Database   | Private    | Until app uninstall    | High        | Structured data                          |
| Room              | Private    | Until app uninstall    | Medium-High | Structured data with compile-time safety |

When choosing a storage method, consider the type of data you're storing, how much data you need to store, the required level of security, and the complexity you're willing to manage in your app.

1. SharedPreferences

SharedPreferences is a framework that allows you to save and retrieve key-value pairs of primitive data types.

**Use Cases**

- Storing user preferences.
- Saving settings or configuration data.

**Advantages:**

- Simple to use for small amounts of data
- Data persists across app restarts

**Disadvantages:**

- Not suitable for large or complex data structures
- Not encrypted by default

**Java Code Example**

```java
// Saving data to SharedPreferences
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
editor.putString("key_name", "value");
editor.apply();

// Retrieving data from SharedPreferences
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
String value = sharedPref.getString("key_name", "default_value");
```

2. Internal Storage

Internal Storage is used to store private data within the device's internal memory.

**Use Cases**

- Storing sensitive data.
- Files that should not be accessible to other apps.

**Advantages:**

- Data is private to the app.
- Files are removed when the app is uninstalled.

**Disadvantages:**

- Limited by device storage.
- Not easily accessible for backup.

**Java Code Example**

```java
// Writing to internal storage
String filename = "myfile";
String fileContents = "Hello, World!";
FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(filename, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
fos.write(fileContents.getBytes());
fos.close();

// Reading from internal storage
FileInputStream fis = openFileInput(filename);
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    sb.append(line);
}
String fileContents = sb.toString();
fis.close();
```

3. External Storage

External Storage is used to store public data on the shared external storage.
It's typically used for storing larger files.

**Use Cases**

- Storing media files (images, videos, audio)
- Documents that need to be shared with other apps.

**Advantages:**

- Larger storage capacity
- Files can be shared with other apps

**Disadvantages:**

- Not secure, as other apps can access the files
- Files may remain after app uninstallation

**Permissions**

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

**Java Code Example**

```java
// Writing to external storage
String filename = "myfile";
String fileContents = "Hello, World!";
File file = new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), filename);
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
fos.write(fileContents.getBytes());
fos.close();

// Reading from external storage
File file = new File(getExternalFilesDir(null), filename);
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
    sb.append(line);
}
String fileContents = sb.toString();
fis.close();
```

4. SQLite Database

SQLite is a lightweight relational database embedded within Android.

**Use Cases**

- Structured data storage.
- Complex querying requirements.
- Managing complex data relationships

**Advantages:**

- Efficient for complex queries and large datasets
- Supports transactions and data integrity

**Disadvantages:**

- More complex to set up and use compared to other options
- Overkill for simple data storage needs

**Java Code Example**

```java
// Creating a database helper
public class MyDatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "mydatabase.db";
    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;

    public MyDatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        db.execSQL("CREATE TABLE mytable (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)");
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
        db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable");
        onCreate(db);
    }
}

// Using the database helper
MyDatabaseHelper dbHelper = new MyDatabaseHelper(context);
SQLiteDatabase db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();

// Inserting data
ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
values.put("name", "John Doe");
long newRowId = db.insert("mytable", null, values);

// Querying data
Cursor cursor = db.query("mytable", new String[]{"id", "name"}, null, null, null, null, null);
while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
    long itemId = cursor.getLong(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow("id"));
    String itemName = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow("name"));
}
cursor.close();
db.close();
```

5. Room Database

Room is an abstraction layer over SQLite that provides a more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

**Use Cases:**

- When you need a robust database solution but want to avoid the complexity of raw SQLite

**Advantages:**

- Compile-time verification of SQL queries
- Convenient annotations to define database structure
- Easy integration with other Architecture components

**Disadvantages:**

- Adds additional dependencies to your project
- May be overkill for very simple data storage needs

**Java Code Example**

```java
// Define Entity
@Entity(tableName = "user")
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int id;
    public String name;
}

// Define DAO
@Dao
public interface UserDao {
    @Insert
    void insert(User user);

    @Query("SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = :id")
    User getUserById(int id);
}

// Define Database
@Database(entities = {User.class}, version = 1)
public abstract class AppDatabase extends RoomDatabase {
    public abstract UserDao userDao();
}

// Using Room
AppDatabase db = Room.databaseBuilder(getApplicationContext(),
        AppDatabase.class, "mydatabase").build();
UserDao userDao = db.userDao();

// Inserting data
User user = new User();
user.id = 1;
user.name = "John Doe";
userDao.insert(user);

// Querying data
User user = userDao.getUserById(1);
```

6. Content Providers

Content Providers manage access to a structured set of data. They encapsulate the data and provide mechanisms for defining data security.

**Use Cases**

- Sharing data between different applications.
- Accessing data from other applications.

**Java Code Example**

```java
// Querying a content provider
Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(
