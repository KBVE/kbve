description: |
    Linux has become the heartbeat of modern infrastructure, driving cloud servers, Kubernetes clusters, desktops, and even the tiniest embedded devices across the world.
    It offers unmatched flexibility, security, and performance for developers, system administrators, and tinkerers alike.
    Whether you're managing containers, automating infrastructure, or exploring the command line, Linux remains the foundation for innovation in the open-source ecosystem.
    This section explores its distributions, tools, and best practices within the KBVE stack.

## Information

Linux is more than just an operating system, its the quiet force that keeps the modern world running.
From the servers that power your favorite websites to the Kubernetes clusters orchestrating entire cloud platforms, Linux is everywhere, often invisible but always essential.
Its open-source roots have created a culture of collaboration and curiosity, where anyone can peek under the hood, make changes, and share improvements with the world.
Whether you're deploying containers, managing infrastructure, or just exploring the command line, understanding Linux means understanding the language of modern computing.

## LVM

**Logical Volume Management (LVM)** provides a flexible way to manage storage on Linux, allowing you to resize, extend, or move partitions without disrupting your system. 
It's especially useful when running Linux inside virtualized environments like [Proxmox](/application/proxmox/), where disk space can be expanded dynamically.

### LVM Extension

<Steps>

1.  **Verify the current layout**  
    Check the existing disks, partitions, and volume groups to understand your current storage configuration.

    ```bash
            sudo lsblk
            # or
            sudo fdisk -l
    ```

2.  **Grow the partition to fill the disk**
    Assuming your disk is `/dev/sda` and the partition is `3`, extend the partition to use the new space.
    
    ```bash

            sudo growpart /dev/sda 3
            # Alternatively, open an interactive resizer:
            sudo cfdisk /dev/sda

    ```

3.  **Resize the Physical Volume (PV)**
    After extending the partition, update the LVM physical volume to recognize the new size.

    ```bash
            sudo pvresize /dev/sda3
    ```

4.  **Extend the Logical Volume (LV)**
    Grow the logical volume to use all the available free space.

    ```bash
            sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
    ```

5.  **Resize the filesystem**
    Expand the filesystem so it can utilize the newly extended logical volume.
    
    ```bash
            sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
    ```

6.  **Verify the result**
    Check that the filesystem now reflects the expected capacity.

    ```bash
            df -h
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">

If you are using XFS instead of EXT4, replace the final resize command with:

```bash
    sudo xfs_growfs /
```

</Aside> 

<Aside type="caution">

Always back up critical data before resizing partitions or volumes.
You can inspect your volume group information at any time with:

```bash
sudo pvs && sudo vgs && sudo lvs
```

</Aside>


To extend the `ubuntu--vg-ubuntu-lv` after increasing the size of a physical volume from Proxmox

For the purposes of simplicity, I'm going to assume that the main volume you wish to extend is `/dev/sda3`.

-   Check the current size with `sudo lsblk` or `sudo fdisk -l`
-   Run either `sudo growpart /dev/sda 3` or use `sudo cfdisk` to resize the `/dev/sda3` to max size
-   Extend the PV volume with `sudo pvresize /dev/sda3`
-   Extend the LV to 100% with `sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`
-   Resize the filesystem with `sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`

## ZSH

The **Z Shell (ZSH)** is a feature-rich shell that builds on Bash, offering improved autocompletion, better history management, and deep customization through plugins and themes.  
It is the go to choice for developers who want a faster, more expressive terminal experience.

<Steps>

1.  **Install ZSH**  
    Make sure ZSH is installed on your system.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install zsh -y
    # or on Fedora / RHEL
    sudo dnf install zsh -y
    # or on Arch
    sudo pacman -S zsh

    ```

2.  **Set ZSH as the default shell**

    ```bash 
    chsh -s $(which zsh)
    ```

    Log out and back in for the change to take effect.

3.  **Install Oh My Zsh**

    Oh My Zsh is a framework that simplifies managing your ZSH configuration and plugins.

    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```

4.  **Add the Powerlevel10k theme**

    Clone the Powerlevel10k theme into your Oh My Zsh themes directory.

    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
    ```

    Edit your ~/.zshrc and set:

    ```bash
    ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
    ```

    Then reload:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

5.  **Install recommended fonts**
    Powerlevel10k uses Nerd Fonts or Meslo LGS NF for icons and symbols.

    ```bash
    # Quick download and install for Meslo fonts (Mac/Linux)
    p10k configure
    ```
    Follow the prompts to install the suggested font and tweak your prompt style.

6.  **Enhance with plugins (optional)**
    You can extend functionality with plugins like:

    ```bash
    plugins=(
        git
        zsh-autosuggestions
        zsh-syntax-highlighting
    )
    ```
    To install:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting

    ```
    
    Then reload once more:
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```


</Steps>

<Aside type="tip"> 
If you're using VS Code's integrated terminal or Windows Terminal, make sure you set the **font** to a Nerd Font (like Meslo LGS NF) in your settings for icons and glyphs to render correctly.
