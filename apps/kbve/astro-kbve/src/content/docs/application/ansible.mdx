## Information

With **Ansible**, you can automate complex IT operations with clarity and control.
It simplifies system management, application deployment, and workflow orchestration through powerful, modular building blocks.
Powered by open source, Python, and SSH, Ansible connects seamlessly to your devicesâ€”no agents required.
It sends lightweight programs called **modules** to perform tasks precisely where they are needed, then removes them once finished.
From provisioning servers to configuring networks and deploying applications, Ansible turns manual, error-prone processes into consistent, repeatable automation.

### Ansible for a Newbie!

Ansible is a tool that helps people do things with computers.
Sometimes people have many computers and they want to do the same thing on all of them.
For example, they might want to make them play a game, or show a picture, or talk to each other.
Doing the same thing on many computers can be hard and boring.
Ansible makes it easy and fun and has a list of things that people want to do with computers.
It can read the list and do the things one by one and then also check if the things are done correctly.
Ansible can talk to different kinds of computers and tell them what to do.
Think of Ansible like a friend that helps people with computers.

## Install

To install **Ansible**, you will need two types of machines:  
a **control node** (where Ansible runs) and one or more **managed nodes** (where Ansible performs tasks).

<Steps>

1. **Set up your Control and Managed Nodes**  
   The **control node** is where you run Ansible commands and playbooks.  
   It can be any UNIX-like system with **Python 3.9+** installed.  
   The **managed node** is any system that supports **Python 2.7+** and communicates via **SSH** (or PowerShell on Windows).

2. **Install Ansible**  
   Depending on your operating system, there are multiple installation paths:

    - **Ubuntu / Debian:** Use `apt install ansible` from the official repositories.
    - **Windows:** Enable **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** and install Ansible using `pip install ansible` or `pip3 install ansible`.
    - **Source:** Clone the [Ansible GitHub repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and build from source to get the latest development version.

3. **Configure Ansible**  
   Set up your **inventory file** to list managed nodes and their connection details.  
   You can further customize settings in the `ansible.cfg` file or override them using environment variables or command-line options.

4. **Verify the Installation**  
   Run a quick test to ensure Ansible is configured properly:

    ```bash
    ansible all -m ping
    ```

    If everything is set up correctly, you will receive a pong response from your managed nodes.

</Steps>

## Playbook

An Ansible playbook is your automation blueprint written in YAML/JSON.
The purpose of the playbook is to tell Ansible what to do, where to do it, and how to do it.
With a playbook, you can transform your IT tasks into simple and repeatable steps that run on any number of hosts.
Whether you need to install software, configure settings, run commands, or anything else, an Ansible playbook will make it happen in a snap.

### Playbook Examples

Let me dazzle you with an example of a playbook that I borrowed from the Ansible documentation.

```yaml
- name: Update web servers
  hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
      - name: Ensure apache is at the latest version
        ansible.builtin.yum:
            name: httpd
            state: latest
      - name: Write the apache config file
        ansible.builtin.template:
            src: /srv/httpd.j2
            dest: /etc/httpd.conf

- name: Update db servers
  hosts: databases
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
      - name: Ensure postgresql is at the latest version
        ansible.builtin.yum:
            name: postgresql
            state: latest
      - name: Ensure that postgresql is started
        ansible.builtin.service:
            name: postgresql
            state: started
```

This playbook has two plays.
The first one updates the web servers by installing the latest version of apache and writing a config file.
The second one updates the database servers by installing the latest version of postgresql and starting the service.
Each play has a name, a list of hosts to target, a remote user to execute the tasks, and a list of tasks to perform.
Each task has a name and a module to call with some parameters.

#### Minecraft Server Update Playbook Example

```yaml
- name: Update Minecraft server
  hosts: minecraft
  vars:
      minecraft_version: latest
      minecraft_url: https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions
      minecraft_home: /srv/minecraft
  tasks:
      - name: Get latest Minecraft version
        uri:
            url: '{{ minecraft_url }}/latest.json'
            return_content: yes
        register: latest_version
        when: minecraft_version == "latest"

      - name: Set Minecraft version
        set_fact:
            minecraft_version: '{{ latest_version.json.id }}'
        when: minecraft_version == "latest"

      - name: Check if Minecraft server jar exists
        stat:
            path: '{{ minecraft_home }}/minecraft_server.{{ minecraft_version }}.jar'
        register: jar_file

      - name: Download Minecraft server jar
        get_url:
            url: '{{ minecraft_url }}/{{ minecraft_version }}/minecraft_server.{{ minecraft_version }}.jar'
            dest: '{{ minecraft_home }}'
        when: not jar_file.stat.exists

      - name: Restart Minecraft service
        systemd:
            name: minecraft
            state: restarted
        when: not jar_file.stat.exists
```

This playbook is composed of four parts:

- The name of the playbook, which is `Update Minecraft server`.
- The hosts that the playbook will run on, which are the ones in the `minecraft` group in the inventory file.
- The variables that the playbook will use, such as `minecraft_version`, `minecraft_url`, and `minecraft_home`.
- The tasks that the playbook will execute, such as getting the latest Minecraft version, downloading the server jar file, and restarting the Minecraft service.

Each task has a name, a module to use, and some parameters for the module.
Some tasks also have a condition (`when`) that determines when they will run.
For example, the task `Download Minecraft server jar` will only run if the jar file does not exist in the `minecraft_home` directory.
The playbook uses the `register` keyword to store the output of some tasks in variables, such as `latest_version` and `jar_file`.
These variables can be used in later tasks or conditions and this playbook could be expanded to include file checks with hashing.

## Modules

<Aside>

> **tldr;** Ansible has a large collection of modules that can be used for various tasks and purposes.

</Aside>

Cloud modules can be used to interact with different cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.

The cloud modules within Ansible are a set of modules that can be used to interact with different cloud providers and services.
They allow you to provision, configure and manage cloud resources, such as virtual machines, networks, storage, databases, etc.

---

### CI/CD Modules

<Aside>
  
  > **tldr;** These modules integrate Ansible automation into continuous integration and delivery workflows, such as GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

</Aside>

The CI/CD modules enable you to run Ansible playbooks directly within automated pipelines.
They are useful for testing, provisioning, or deploying infrastructure and applications as part of your workflow.

| Module / Action                   | Description                                                       |
| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ansible/ansible-lint-action`     | Runs `ansible-lint` to validate playbooks and roles.              |
| `ansible/ansible-playbook-action` | Executes an Ansible playbook inside your GitHub Actions workflow. |
| `ansible/galaxy-action`           | Manages Ansible Galaxy roles and collections in your pipeline.    |

<Aside type="tip">
	You can combine these with AWS or Azure modules in later stages of your
	workflow to deploy cloud infrastructure automatically after tests pass.

### AWS Modules

<Aside>
	These modules can be used to work with Amazon Web Services (AWS), such as
	EC2, S3, CloudFormation, etc. For example, you can use the
	`amazon.aws.ec2_instance` module to create and manage EC2 instances on AWS.
</Aside>

Ansible provides a wide range of **AWS modules** that let you automate tasks across Amazon Web Services, from launching EC2 instances to managing S3 buckets, security groups, and CloudFormation stacks.
These modules use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) under the hood, allowing secure, API-based interaction with your cloud resources.
You can use them to playbooks to **create, configure, and delete** infrastructure components, making it easy to manage everything as code aka `IaaC`.

| Module                          | Description                                            |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `amazon.aws.ec2_instance`       | Create and manage EC2 instances.                       |
| `amazon.aws.s3_bucket`          | Create, delete, and configure S3 buckets.              |
| `amazon.aws.cloudformation`     | Deploy infrastructure stacks using AWS CloudFormation. |
| `amazon.aws.iam_user`           | Manage IAM users and access permissions.               |
| `amazon.aws.ec2_security_group` | Define and modify EC2 security groups.                 |

<Aside type="caution">

> Before using these modules, ensure you have installed the `amazon.aws` collection and configured your AWS **credentials** properly using aws configure or environment variables.

</Aside>

---

### Azure Modules

With these modules, you have full control over your Microsoft Azure resources, whether they are VMs, Storage, Network or anything else.
For example, you can use the `azure_rm_virtualmachine` module to create and manage Azure virtual machines.

---

### GCP Modules

You can work with any Google Cloud Platform service with these modules, such as Compute Engine, Storage, Network and more.
The `gcp_compute_instance` module is an example of how you can achieve your goals with GCP servers using Ansible.

> [Official Documentation on GCP Compute Instance module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/google/cloud/gcp_compute_instance_module.html)

#### Create GCP Instance

Creating a compute instance with a specific name, zone, machine type, image and network:

```yaml
- name: create gcp instance
  google.cloud.gcp_compute_instance:
      name: test_object
      zone: us-central1-a
      machine_type: n1-standard-1
      disks:
          - auto_delete: true
            boot: true
            source: '{{ disk }}'
      network_interfaces:
          - network: '{{ network }}'
            access_configs:
                - name: External NAT
                  nat_ip: '{{ address }}'
                  type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
      state: present
```

This example creates a compute instance with a specific name, zone, machine type, image and network.
It uses the `state: present` parameter to indicate that the instance should exist.
It also specifies the `disks` and `network_interfaces` parameters to configure the disk and network settings of the instance.
The `disk` and `network` variables are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the playbook or inventory.

#### Delete GCP Instance

Deleting a compute instance with a specific name and zone:

```yaml
- name: dlete gcp instance
  google.cloud.gcp_compute_instance:
      name: test_object
      zone: us-central1-a
      state: absent
```

For this task, it deletes a compute instance with a specific `name` and `zone`.
It uses the `state: absent` parameter to indicate that the instance should not exist.
It does not need to specify any other parameters, as the `name` and `zone` are enough to identify the instance to delete.

#### Update GCP Instance

Updating a compute instance with a new machine type and labels

```yaml
- name: update gcp instance
  google.cloud.gcp_compute_instance:
      name: test_object
      zone: us-central1-a
      machine_type: n1-standard-2
      labels:
          env: prod
          webserver: nginx
      state: present
```

The update example performs the task of updating a compute instance with a new machine type and labels.
It uses the `state: present` parameter to indicate that the instance should exist.
It also specifies the `machine_type` and `labels` parameters to change the machine type and labels of the instance.
The machine type determines the CPU and memory resources of the instance, and the labels are key-value pairs that can be used to organize and filter instances.
Any other parameters that are not specified will remain unchanged.

---

### OpenStack Modules

OpenStack modules can be used to work with OpenStack, an open source cloud platform that provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
The `os_server` module is an example of how you can have full control over your OpenStack servers.

---

### Network Modules

You can configure and manage any network device with these modules, such as routers, switches, firewalls and beyond.

---

### System Modules

With these modules, you have full control over your system resources, whether they are users, groups, files, directories, services, packages or anything else.

---

### Database Modules

Employing these modules, you have full control over your database servers and objects, from MySQL and PostgreSQL to MongoDB and more.

---

### Windows Modules

Windows modules can be used to manage Windows systems and applications, such as Active Directory, IIS, PowerShell, etc.
For example, you can use the `win_service` module to manage Windows service

---
