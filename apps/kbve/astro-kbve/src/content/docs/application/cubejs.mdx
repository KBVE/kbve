## Install

There are several ways to install CubeJS, including using it as a SaaS via CubeJS Cloud.
We will go over a couple ways in this reference document.

### Docker

There are a couple ways that we can deploy CubeJS via Docker, including dev mode and swarm.

These following commands will run CubeJS in a docker container and expose it on port 4000 / 3000.
Furthermore, it will also mount the current directory as a volume for CubeJS configuration and schema files.

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 4000:4000 \
  -e CUBEJS_DB_HOST=postgres://hostname \
  -e CUBEJS_DB_NAME=<DB_NAME> \
  -e CUBEJS_DB_USER=<USER> \
  -e CUBEJS_DB_PASS=<PASS> \
  -e CUBEJS_DB_TYPE=<DB_TYPE> \
  -e CUBEJS_API_SECRET=<API_SECRET> \
  -v $(pwd):/cube/conf \
  cubejs/cube:latest
```

To enable dev mode, pass along the environmental variable `-e CUBEJS_DEV_MODE=true \` inside of the command.

For the Docker Swarm, we recommend that you deploy a CubeJS Docker Compose via Portainer or your swarm platform of choice.

### NodeJS

> Reference to additional [NodeJS docs](/application/javascript/#nodejs)

For installing via NodeJS, we recommend you install cubejs-cli using npm or yarn, which are tools that help you manage JavaScript packages. You can run this command in your terminal:

-   NPM

```shell
npm install -g cubejs-cli
```

-   YARN

```shell
yarn add cubejs-cli
```

After the installation, we recommend that you launch a test case.

Create a new CubeJS project using cubejs create command.
You need to specify the name of your project and the type of your data source.
For example, if you want to use Postgres, which is a database system, you can run this command:

```shell
cubejs create dashboard-backend -d postgres
```

This will create a new folder with your project files and install the necessary dependencies.
You can then start your CubeJS server by running this command inside your project folder:

-   NPM

```shell
npm run dev
```

-   YARN

```shell
yarn dev
```

This will start your CubeJS test case server on `http://localhost:4000`.
You can then open this URL in your browser and follow the instructions to connect to your data source and start building your data model and queries.

## Update

To upgrade CubeJS, you need to update the version of the CubeJS package that you are using.
There are different ways to do that, depending on how you installed CubeJS.

### Update Docker

If you are using Docker, you can upgrade CubeJS by pulling the latest image from the Docker Hub.
You can run this command in your terminal:

```shell
docker pull cubejs/cube:latest
```

### Update NodeJS

If you are using Node.js, you can upgrade CubeJS by updating the version of the `@cubejs-backend/server` or `@cubejs-backend/server-core` package in your `package.json` file.
You can also use npm or yarn to update the package. For example, you can run this command in your terminal:

-   NPM

```shell
npm update @cubejs-backend/server
```

-   YARN

```shell
yarn upgrade @cubejs-backend/server
```
