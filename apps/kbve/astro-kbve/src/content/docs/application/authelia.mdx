## Install

There are a couple ways we can install Autheila, here are the official deployment notes for each:

- [Docker](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/docker/)
- [Kubernetes](https://www.authelia.com/integration/kubernetes/introduction/)
- [Bare Metal](https://www.authelia.com/integration/deployment/bare-metal/)

### Prerequisites

Having a decent understanding of the operating system, networking and containerization will be extremely helpful!

One of the fundamental situations that you have to account for is that Autheila has to operate under SSL!
The default port that Autheila runs on is 9091, but this can be changed as well.

Finally, if you have Cloudflare sitting infront of your domain, then we recommend double checking your forwarded headers, Autheila provides a guide on that [here](https://www.authelia.com/integration/proxies/fowarded-headers/).

### Docker

This section will cover the deployment of Autheila via Docker!

We are currently using the DockerHub image, `authelia/authelia` but you can also opt to use their Github image as well.

Since our eco-system currently uses `Traefik` to manage, we recommend that you follow the documentation related to its [integration](https://www.authelia.com/integration/proxies/traefik/).
