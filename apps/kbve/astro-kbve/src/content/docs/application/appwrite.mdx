## Javascript

More information for [javascript](/application/javascript)

This part of the documentation is no longer valid for Appwrite 1.4+, as they have changed their functions.

We split the functions into three different areas:

1. `Init` - Which initializes the serverless function, handling the installs if using different libaries, ect...
2. `Core` - These are the notes for the core serverless function.
3. `Extra` - Additional notes and information regarding the expansion of a serverless function.

### Init

Hello there, fellow developers! ðŸš€

Today, we're diving deep into the world of cloud functions with a special focus on Appwrite - a wonderful platform that allows you to build secure web and mobile applications faster.

### What is a Cloud Function?

At its core, a cloud function is a piece of code that runs in response to an event.
You donâ€™t need to manage the infrastructure; the cloud provider does that for you.
Think of it as "Function as a Service" (FaaS).
Cloud functions are a key part of the serverless architecture, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### Initializing Your Appwrite Cloud Function

1. `Function Creation` :

    - Head over to your Appwrite Console, navigate to the Functions section, and click on `Add Function`.
    - Give your function a name and choose a runtime (e.g., Node.js, Python, Deno, etc.).

2. `Code Your Function` :

    - Reference Core for the basics.
    - Here is a basic / starter.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = async (req, res) => {
    	const payload =
    		req.payload ||
    		'No payload provided. Add custom data when executing function.';

    	const secretKey =
    		req.variables.SECRET_KEY ||
    		'SECRET_KEY variable not found. You can set it in Function settings.';

    	const randomNumber = Math.random();

    	const trigger = req.variables.APPWRITE_FUNCTION_TRIGGER;

    	res.json({
    		message: 'Hello from Appwrite!',
    		payload,
    		secretKey,
    		randomNumber,
    		trigger,
    	});
    };
    ```

3. `Packaging` :

    - Cloud functions in Appwrite run inside Docker containers, so your function and any dependencies need to be packed into a tarball. For Node.js:
      `tar -czf code.tar.gz --exclude code.tar.gz .`

4. `Deployment` :
    - Upload Your Code: Back in the Appwrite Console, under your function, click on the Deploy Tag button.
    - Upload the code.tar.gz file.
    - Set Your Triggers! Functions can respond to various events, like user registration or document creation. Select the triggers relevant to your use case.
    - Execute! With everything set, hit the Execute button. Your function will run, and you can see the logs in real-time.

Yay! Congratulations, youâ€™ve just deployed your first Appwrite Cloud Function! ðŸŽ‰
The power of serverless lies in its simplicity and scalability.
As your application grows, you can continue adding more functions without the hassle of managing servers or infrastructure.

I hope this introduction helps kickstart your journey with Appwrite Cloud Functions.
Stay tuned for more in-depth tutorials, and happy coding! ðŸš€

### Core

General documentation and information in reference to the cloud functions / open runtime for Appwrite.

Remember to import the SDK outside of the module function.

The main `module.exports` is usually written like this

```javascript
module.exports = async function (req, res) {}; // Passing req and res
```

The `req` contains these three main objects:

`req.headers` - An object with the request headers for the function.
`req.payload` - An object with the payload, which is the main body data.
`req.env` - An object with the environment data.

The `res` can return two main objects:

`res.send` - returns a `text` and `statusCode`.
`res.json` - returns an `object` and `statusCode`.

Example of parsing the `req.payload` check and `res.json` return.

```javascript
if (req.payload) {
	try {
		payload = JSON.parse(req.payload);
	} catch (error) {
		errorHandler('Corrupt payload for the function.');
	}
} else {
	errorHandler('Missing payload for the function.');
}
```

In this case our `errorHandler` function would be:

```javascript
const errorHandler = (__errorMessage, statusCode = 418) => {
	res.json({ data: 'error', message: __errorMessage }, statusCode);
};
```

### Extra

In the context of Appwrite Cloud Functions, "extra libraries" refer to external dependencies or packages that your function might need to execute correctly.
Due to the isolated nature of cloud functions, they don't inherently have access to all the libraries or tools available in a full-fledged server environment.
To overcome this, Appwrite allows you to bundle these additional libraries with your function code.
When you're developing your function, you specify and package these librariesâ€”be it npm packages for a Node.js function, pip packages for a Python function, or any other dependencies for other runtimes.
Once bundled, Appwrite ensures that these libraries are available to your function at runtime, providing a seamless execution environment tailored to your specific needs.

-   For data fetching, we recommend that you add an external module known as `axios`.
    -   `const axios = require("axios").default;`

## Python

The Appwrite Python SDK allows Python developers to interact with Appwrite's API, facilitating tasks like user authentication, database operations, storage, and more.
By using this SDK, Python developers can seamlessly integrate and manage Appwrite services in their applications, without delving into the complexities of direct API calls.

Step aside traditional backends, the Appwrite Python SDK is in town, rolling out the red carpet for Pythonistas eager to elevate their web and mobile projects!
This snazzy toolkit doesn't just connect Python applications to the Appwrite server; it's a golden ticket to a carnival of backend delights.
From the tantalizing whirlwind of user authentication to the magic show of database operations and the high-flying trapeze of storage management, the SDK transforms mundane backend tasks into a spectacle.
No more wrestling with manual API requests â€“ just harness the SDK's sleek methods and watch as Appwrite's vast services dance harmoniously with your Python code.
Whether you're orchestrating a symphony of user data or choreographing a ballet of notifications, the Appwrite Python SDK ensures every act is a showstopper or a stormtrooper muhahaha.

### Appwrite Python SDK Install

Python wizards, gather 'round! Elevate your coding cauldron with a sprinkle of Appwrite magic by simply chanting `pip install appwrite`.
And just like that, your Python broomstick is turbocharged and ready to soar through the backend skies!

Calling the `appwrite` in python is really easy! Just add this below:

```python

from appwrite.client import Client

client = Client()

client = (client
    .set_endpoint('https://ap.kbve.com/v1') # Your API Endpoint
    .set_project('[PROJECT_ID]')                # Your project ID
    .set_key('919c2db5d4...a2a3346ad2')          # Your secret API key
)

```

And you will be good to go!

### Appwrite Python SDK Demo

Here is a quick and easy demo for Appwrite python below!

```python

from appwrite.client import Client
from appwrite.id import ID
from appwrite.services.users import Users

client = Client()

client = (client
    .set_endpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1') # Your API Endpoint
    .set_project('[PROJECT_ID]')                # Your project ID
    .set_key('919c2db5d4...a2a3346ad2')          # Your secret API key
)

users = Users(client)

user = users.create(
    user_id=ID.unique(),
    email='email@example.com',
    phone=None,
    password='password'
)

```
