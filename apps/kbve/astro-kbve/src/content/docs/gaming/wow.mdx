## World of Warcraft


This is still a proof of concept guide and needs to be worked on.


<Adsense />

However for the time being, I am going to start the document and then reference it back when I get more information.


### Addons

For the best addon management experience in World of Warcraft, opt for CurseForge.
It provides a user-friendly interface, easy installation, and automatic updates for your addons. 
Plus it has a vast library of addons, you can customize your gameplay easily and share it across multiple computers too.


### Macros

This is a quick breakdown of all the macros that we will be using, I am currently playing between a warrior and a warlock but I will try to keep them noted here for future reference.

#### LFG / LFM Macro

Now the LFG macro would be great

#### Fast Consumable Buff

A quick macro that will help apply buffs and potions.
This is still a wor

```
/castsequence reset=30 [@player] Scroll of Spirit, Elixir of Minor Defense, Rumsey Rum Light, Boiled Clams
```

#### Skinning

This is a quick macro for skinning the last target after its been killed and looted.

```
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()
/targetlasttarget
/run if UnitIsDead("target") then InteractUnit("target") end
/cast [dead, exists] Skinning
```

#### Priest

##### Pain + Wand

Single button to apply pain and follow up with wand attack.

```
#showtooltip Shadow Word: Pain
/cast [mod:alt] !Shoot; Shadow Word: Pain
/castsequence [nomod] reset=2 !Shoot, null
```

The macro goes `Shadow Word: Pain` into `!Shoot` but when holding alt and casting it will only do shoot.
Mod change was by Chip.

#### Hunter

##### Pet, Hunters Mark + Auto Shot

A simple but quick marco that will send your pet to attack, apply the hunters mark and start to auto attack.

```
/petattack
/cast Hunter's Mark
/cast !Auto Shot
```

##### Sting + Auto Shot

```
/cast Serpent Sting
/cast !Auto Shot
```

##### Arcane + Auto Shot

```
/cast !Auto Shot
/cast Arcane Shot
```

#### Warrior

##### Weapon Swap Macro

The one button macro switches from two handed to one handed with shield.

```
/equipslot 16 $2H_item_name
/equipslot 16 $One_hand_item_name
/equipslot 17 $Shield

```

Remember to swap out the names of the `$2H_item_name`, ect... with the items you have in your bag.

##### Charge,Rend,Throw

This is a quick macro to cast `Charge` in non-combat, then Rend if in combat and finally a quick throw without a modshift.

```
/cast [nocombat] Charge; Rend
/cast Throw
```

This macro still needs to be worked on.

#### Mage Macros

##### Frostbolt

Quick macro for a frost bolt

```lua
/run UIErrorsFrame:Hide()
/use [combat] Berserking
/run UIErrorsFrame:Clear(); UIErrorsFrame:Show()
/cast Frostbolt
```

##### Arcane Missles + FrostBolt Rank 1 

This is my starter combat macro for my ice hardcore mage!
If you are not in combat, it will cast the Arcane Missiles but if you are in-combat then it will fire off a rank 1 frostbolt to apply the slow.

```lua
/stopcasting
/script if UnitExists("target") then SetRaidTarget("target", 8) end
/cast [nocombat,harm,nodead] Arcane Missiles; [harm,nodead] Frostbolt(Rank 1)
/em zug zug missiles incoming
```

##### Frostbolt + Wand

```lua
/cast Frostbolt
/castsequence reset=2 !Shoot, null
```

#### Warlock

##### Pet Attack + Wand via Shoot

```
/petattack
/castsequence reset=2 !Shoot, null
```

##### Pet Attack + DoT 

```
/petattack
/castsequence [@mouseover,harm,exists,nodead] [nochanneling] reset=target Curse of Agony, Corruption, Immolate, Life Tap
/em applying dat D O T
```

This macro is part of the `tab`, `111` rotation and helps you throw your damage over time.

#### Rogue

##### Throw + Sinister Strike

This macro will cast throw when you are not in combat or cast sinister strike when you are in combat!
It also throws a blue square up on the target and can cast your racial ability.
Remember to swap out `Berserking` with whatever spell you would like to combo it with!

```
/startattack
/cast [nocombat] Throw; [combat] Sinister Strike
/run if UnitExists("target") and not GetRaidTargetIndex("target") then SetRaidTarget("target", 6) end
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()
```

Troll-Only Version , includes Berserking.

```
/startattack
/cast [nocombat] Throw; [combat] Sinister Strike
/cast [combat] Berserking
/run if UnitExists("target") and not GetRaidTargetIndex("target") then SetRaidTarget("target", 6) end
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()


```

##### Pick Pocket + Garrorte

This is a macro for when you are already in stealth!
It will pick pocket and then garrote the humanoid, however the loot for the pick pocket does not appear until after.

```
/use Pick Pocket
/cast Garrote
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()
```

##### Stealth OR Slice & Dice, Eviscerate

```
/cast [nocombat] Stealth
/castsequence [combat] reset=target/combat Slice and Dice, Eviscerate
```

#### Guild

This is our guild macro for messaging around in general chat!

```
/script SendChatMessage("Looking for a friendly leveling guild? Join <One Life To Live>! We offer active players, friendly community, and helpful members. Whisper me for an invite!", "CHANNEL", nil, GetChannelName("General - " .. GetZoneText()))
```

#### Camera

##### Camera Zoom In


```lua

/script SetCVar("cameraDistanceMax",5)
/console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 4

```
