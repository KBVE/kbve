## Guides

### Starter Guide

You just installed Bitcraft and need a quick guide on getting started?
We recommend that you finish all the tutorial island and then teleport to `Cinderhold`.
Remember that there is a cost when using the teleport!
At `Cinderhold` or any starter town, you can focus on getting your skills up, we recommend getting just the basic levels to help you understand how the skills work.
To get started with fishing, head over to the near by lake and start to fish the crawdads, which are small fish.
Keep your food supply high, that is the name of the game, the fish have a multi-stage purpose as well.
The crawdads will be used to turn into bait.

#### Goals

Your first couple goals should be getting a personal cache, a raft and upgrading your cart.
How you reach these goals are up to you but they are core parts of the game and should be done asap!
