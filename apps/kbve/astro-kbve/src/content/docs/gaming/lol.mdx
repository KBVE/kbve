## HotKeys

League of Legends features a comprehensive set of default hotkeys designed to enhance gameplay efficiency and responsiveness.
Players can cast their champion's abilities using the Q, W, E, and R keys, while summoner spells are assigned to D and F.
Items in inventory slots 1 through 7 can be activated directly, and recalling to the base is bound to the B key.
To facilitate communication and tactical coordination, the game offers a ping system accessible via the G key and Alt + Left-click for various types of alerts.
Essential commands such as opening the shop (P), viewing the scoreboard (O), and centering the camera (Spacebar) are also readily accessible.
Quick casting, which allows abilities to be cast instantly at the cursor location, can be toggled using Alt + Q, W, E, R, and further customized via the in-game options menu.
Players can level up abilities quickly using Ctrl + Q, W, E, R and express themselves with champion emotes (Ctrl + 1, 2, 3, 4) and the Mastery Emote (Ctrl + 6).
The FPS and ping display can be toggled with Ctrl + F, providing real-time performance metrics.
Furthermore, all hotkeys can be re-bound to different keys through the options menu, allowing for a personalized and optimized control scheme to suit individual player preferences.
This level of customization ensures that every player can tailor their gameplay experience to their own comfort and strategic needs.

Here is a full table of the hot keys below!
