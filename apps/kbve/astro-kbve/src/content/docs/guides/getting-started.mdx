    Official documentation for setting up the KBVE monorepo and exploring the full suite of open source tools.
    The repository spans Rust, TypeScript, Python, and C# with projects managed through Nx and pnpm workspaces.
    This guide covers environment setup using Homebrew, project structure, and the workflow for submitting contributions.
    Whether you are building web applications, automation pipelines, or game prototypes, you will find the relevant starting points here.

Welcome to the KBVE documentation.
This guide walks you through every tool, service, and framework that powers the KBVE ecosystem.
You will find setup instructions for the monorepo, descriptions of each project, and tutorials written for developers at every experience level.
The stack spans Rust, TypeScript, Python, C#, and several web frameworks, so there is a lot of ground to cover.
Start here, explore at your own pace, and refer back whenever you need a refresher.

## Prerequisites

Every dependency in the KBVE monorepo can be installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
Homebrew runs on macOS, Linux, and WSL, so these instructions work across all three platforms.
If you do not have Homebrew yet, install it first by running the command on the [official site](https://brew.sh).

For deeper reference on individual tools, see the application docs linked below.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to clone and run the KBVE monorepo.
Each command block can be copied directly into your terminal.

<Steps>

1. Install [Git](/application/git/) through Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install git
    ```

2. Install [Python](/application/python/) 3.14 and confirm the version:

    ```bash
    brew install python@3.14
    python3.14 --version
    ```

3. Install [Node.js](/application/javascript/) and pnpm in one step:

    ```bash
    brew install node pnpm
    ```

4. Install the .NET SDK for any C# projects in the repo:

    ```bash
    brew install dotnet
    ```

5. Install [Rust](/application/rust/) through rustup so you can manage toolchains and targets:

    ```bash
    brew install rustup
    rustup-init
    ```

    Follow the on screen prompts, then reload your shell or run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`.

6. Add the Rust compilation targets used by KBVE projects:

    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
    rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
    rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    ```

    The `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is required for any WebAssembly builds.
    The `wasm32-wasip1` target is used for WASI based server side modules.
    The Linux targets allow cross compilation from macOS when building release binaries.

7. Optionally install [Docker](/application/docker/) if you plan to work with containerized services:

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Docker Desktop">

    ```bash
    brew install --cask docker
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="OrbStack">

    [OrbStack](/application/docker/#orb) is a lightweight alternative to Docker Desktop built for macOS.
    It uses fewer resources and starts containers faster while remaining fully compatible with the Docker CLI.

    ```bash
    brew install --cask orbstack
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

8. Clone the KBVE repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git
    ```

9. Change into the cloned repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd kbve
    ```

10. Install the project dependencies using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

11. Start the development server with the code watcher:

    ```bash
    ./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:dev
    ```

12. Create a new branch when you are ready to open a pull request:

    ```bash
    ./kbve.sh -atomic you can type anything here and spaces do not matter
    ```

    This generates a branch name from the text you provide after the flag.

13. Open Visual Studio Code from the repository root if it is not already running:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

14. Visual Studio Code will suggest the workspace recommended plugins on first launch.
    Install them and reload the editor when prompted.

</Steps>

## Cleaning and Maintenance

<Aside type="tip">
  Before running any cleanup commands, commit or stash any work in progress so nothing is lost.
</Aside>

Keeping your local environment clean prevents build errors and dependency conflicts over time.
Run `pnpm clean` periodically to remove stale artifacts, and pull the latest changes from main before starting new work.
