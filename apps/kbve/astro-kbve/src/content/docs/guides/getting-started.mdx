## Cleaning and Maintenance

<Aside type="tip">
  Always unplug tools before cleaning. Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe the
  exterior and store in a dry place.
</Aside>

Regular maintenance ensures longevity and safety. Clean your tools after each use, check for wear, and lubricate moving parts as specified in the tool's manual.
