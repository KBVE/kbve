> Starting a new [project](/project/) is exciting and full of possibilities, though it comes with its own set of challenges.
The key to success is solid preparation and smart planning.
That's where the KBVE First Project Checklist comes in, giving you a clear, structured roadmap to keep you on track from start to finish.
With each step laid out, you can move through the process with confidence, ready to tackle obstacles and hit milestones along the way.
Let's get started and make your project a rewarding experience.


## Project Preparation

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Scope and Objectives">
    - Define the project's scope, deliverables, and desired outcomes upfront
    - Identify what a minimum viable version looks like so you know when to ship
    - Set clear success criteria — what does "done" mean for this project?
    - List any known constraints (budget, timeline, tech limitations)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tools and Environment">
    - List all required tools, frameworks, and dependencies
    - Set up version control ([Git](/application/git/)) and agree on a branching strategy
    - Configure linting, formatting, and any shared editor settings
    - Verify that every contributor can build and run the project locally
  </Card>
  <Card title="Arranging Resources">
    - Coordinate with your team or KBVE resources early if you need extra expertise
    - Clarify timelines, roles, and who owns each deliverable
    - Set up a communication channel (Discord, Slack, etc.) for quick decisions
    - Document key decisions in a shared place so nothing gets lost
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Project Execution
### Initial Phase
<Steps>
1. Set up the project [repository](/application/git/) and configure your development environment using the relevant KBVE guides.

2. Align with your team on project goals, coding standards, and workflow conventions

3. Break the project into manageable tasks and assign ownership for each area

4. Establish regular checkpoints and milestones to track progress and catch issues early

5. Run through an initial build or prototype to validate your setup before diving into full development
</Steps>


## Staying Organized

Once your project is underway, keeping tasks visible and manageable is just as important as the initial setup.
How you organize that work depends on the type of project and your team's preferences.
Below are the most common approaches — pick one or combine elements from several.

### Project Management Styles

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Kanban">
    A visual, flow-based system. Tasks live on a board and move through columns like **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

    **Best for:** Ongoing work, maintenance, or projects where priorities shift often.

    - See all active tasks and their status at a glance
    - Spot bottlenecks by watching where cards pile up
    - No fixed timeboxes — work flows continuously
    - Easy to start with and adapt over time

    Check out the [KBVE Kanban Board](/kanban/) to see this in action.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Scrum">
    A sprint-based approach. Work is planned in short cycles (usually 1–2 weeks), with a defined set of tasks committed to each sprint.

    **Best for:** Feature-driven development with a dedicated team.

    - Work is broken into a prioritized backlog
    - Each sprint has a clear goal and a fixed scope
    - Daily standups keep the team in sync
    - A review at the end of each sprint captures what worked and what didn't
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Waterfall">
    A sequential, phase-based process. Each stage (requirements, design, build, test, deploy) is completed before the next begins.

    **Best for:** Projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.

    - Clear milestones and deliverables at each phase
    - Straightforward to plan and estimate upfront
    - Less flexibility to change direction mid-project
    - Works well when external dependencies or approvals gate each phase
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hybrid">
    A mix-and-match approach. Many teams combine elements — for example, sprint planning from Scrum with a kanban board for daily tracking.

    **Best for:** Teams that want structure without rigid rules.

    - Take what works from each methodology and drop what doesn't
    - Use timeboxed sprints for planning but a kanban board for visibility
    - Adapt the process as the team and project evolve
    - Focus on outcomes over ceremony
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

There's no single right answer. Start with the style that feels natural for your project, and adjust as you learn what works for your team.
