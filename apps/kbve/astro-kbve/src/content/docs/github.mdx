## Implementation Plan for GitHub Ecosystem Page

### Phase 1: Core Components

1. **GitHubOrgStats Component**
   - Display organization-level statistics (total repos, stars, forks, contributors)
   - Fetch from GitHub API: `https://api.github.com/orgs/KBVE`
   - Show aggregate metrics across all repositories

2. **RepoCard Component**
   - Individual repository card showing: name, description, stars, forks, language, last updated
   - Link to repo and optional live demo
   - Language color indicators (similar to GitHub)

3. **RepoGrid Component**
   - Filterable/sortable grid of all KBVE repositories
   - Filter by: language, topic, activity level
   - Sort by: stars, forks, recently updated, name

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

4. **ContributorShowcase Component**
   - Top contributors across all repos
   - Contribution heatmap or activity graph
   - Link to contributor profiles

5. **LanguageBreakdown Component**
   - Pie/donut chart showing language distribution
   - Click to filter repos by language

6. **ActivityFeed Component**
   - Recent commits, PRs, releases across repos
   - Timeline view of organization activity

### Phase 3: Interactive Features

7. **RepoSearch Component**
   - Full-text search across repo names and descriptions
   - Autocomplete suggestions

8. **TopicCloud Component**
   - Visual cloud of repository topics
   - Click to filter by topic

9. **StatsOverTime Component**
   - Growth charts (stars, forks, contributors over time)
   - Requires data caching/historical tracking

### Technical Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: GitHub API has rate limits (60 req/hr unauthenticated, 5000 authenticated)
  - Consider server-side caching or static generation at build time
  - Use GitHub GraphQL API for more efficient queries

- **Data Freshness**:
  - Option A: Build-time fetch (stale but fast)
  - Option B: Client-side fetch with skeleton loading
  - Option C: Hybrid with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

- **Skeleton Loading**: Match the pattern from AskamaProfileProvider for consistent UX

### API Endpoints Needed

```
GET https://api.github.com/orgs/KBVE
GET https://api.github.com/orgs/KBVE/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated
GET https://api.github.com/orgs/KBVE/members
GET https://api.github.com/repos/KBVE/{repo}/contributors
GET https://api.github.com/repos/KBVE/{repo}/languages
```

### Component File Structure

```
src/components/github/
├── GitHubOrgStats.astro        # Org-level stats banner
├── RepoCard.astro              # Individual repo card
├── RepoGrid.astro              # Grid container with filters
├── RepoGridReact.tsx           # Interactive React version
├── ContributorShowcase.astro   # Top contributors section
├── LanguageBreakdown.tsx       # Interactive chart (React)
├── ActivityFeed.astro          # Recent activity timeline
└── index.ts                    # Barrel exports
```

### Suggested Starting Point

Start with a simple static version:
1. Create GitHubOrgStats - fetches org data at build time
2. Create RepoCard - displays single repo info
3. Create RepoGrid - maps repos to cards
4. Add client-side interactivity later (search, filters, sorting)

## Coming Soon

The KBVE GitHub Ecosystem page is under development. This page will showcase:

- All KBVE open-source repositories
- Organization statistics and metrics
- Top contributors and their activity
- Language distribution across projects
- Recent commits and releases
- Searchable and filterable repo browser

For now, visit our GitHub organization directly:

**[github.com/KBVE](https://github.com/KBVE)**
