Rareicon is a sci-fi, Action-RPG Shooter set in the Shaco Nebulae, the Outer Rim of the Galaxy in the Great-Cyber Year of 2101. 
You are an indentured Student-worker, shackled by inherited generational debt. 
As your Social Credit Score dwindles to the dangerous "Purge-on-Sight" values, you must navigate the information superhighway for Paydata and Digital Dolans to manage your debt, credit, and sanity. 
Beware; as these tickers tick tick down, the long reach of the Demoncorps approach. 

Glittering, popping, snapping - the gnashing of Demoncode thrums through your rented cerebracket, loan-drilled to your cranium. 
It's just fast enough for you to get the job done. 
Your social credit, and galactic debt twinkle down in flashing numbers in your displays and guages and soon enough they will come for you. 
Your consciousness has been commoditized, and if you cannot produce, then you will simply be reduced. 
As bio-organic computing resource you will help shift the bottomline of the Daemoncorps, ever slightly enough. 
Your mission? It does not matter. 
It's only a matter of time before you are downloaded entirely, but until then your neurons scream through cyberspace - shattering the molds holding valuable Paydata, any bit of information worth even a fraction of cash to the Cyberdaemoncorps. 
Failing that, your mere presence introduces digi-entropy, as garbage meme code is left in your wake - courtesy of the RogueJester protocol.
You live to destroy the hateful digital construct you've been left to.
You are the program.
You are RogueJester, and one way or the other, you will have the last laugh!

### Revision Pre V1

Rareicon is a 2D sci-fi Action-RPG shooter set in the corrupted neon-glow of a failing galactic economy.
As a debt-enslaved worker in the Great Cyber Year 2101, your only path to survival is through hacking, looting paydata, and resisting the soul crushing descent into biocommoditized servitude.

Blending bullet-hell roguelite chaos with strategic base building, Rareicon challenges you to survive escalating system threats, upgrade your sanctuary, and carve a glitch-ridden path through a collapsing infosphere.

Armed with a jury-rigged neural implant and a dying social credit score, you play as Chip, a last generational human, who is debt ridden and scraping through the dataslums of the nebulae.
You'll navigate procedurally generated zones riddled with hostile Daemoncorps patrols, broken AIs, corrupted data vaults, and reality bending demonlike anomalies.

Core gameplay combines WASD movement with mouse-based shooting, blending responsive point-and-click precision with spellcasting and auto-aim support tools to handle the digital chaos.

Along the way, you'll recruit fellow outcasts, rogue constructs, and glitch-born entities to join your fight against the megastructure.
Every run chips away at your identity, but also chips back at the system.

Will you escape the purge or become digital ghost matter?
