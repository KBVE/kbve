### Weighted Shuffle

The "Weighted Shuffle" feature revolutionizes the way you experience music by allowing you to personalize the frequency with which songs from different genres are played.
By assigning a weight from 0 to 10 to each genre, you can tailor the playlist to suit your mood or preferences at any given moment.
A higher weight increases the probability of songs from that genre being played next, enabling dynamic control over your music listening experience.
This feature ensures that your favorite genres are more prominently featured, while still offering a diverse listening experience.

<Aside type='tip'>

Experiment with different weights in the Weighted Shuffle to fine-tune your listening experience.
Start with your favorite genre at a higher weight and adjust others accordingly.
Remember, setting a genre's weight to 0 excludes it from the shuffle, perfect for when you're in the mood for something specific!

## Music Theory

Music theory systematically explores the structures and systems that underpin musical creation and interpretation.
Serving as a foundational framework, music theory equips composers and performers with the understanding needed to effectively manipulate elements such as harmony, melody, rhythm, and texture.
Students of music theory gain valuable insights into the complex interactions among these elements, enhancing their compositional creativity and performance skills.
A deepened appreciation of musical works across diverse genres and historical periods often accompanies this knowledge.
Whether just starting out and aiming to grasp the basics, or an experienced musician intent on refining their craft, mastering music theory proves indispensable.

<Aside type='tip' title='Tips for Learning Music Theory'>

-   **Start with the basics**: Mastering the fundamentals of music theory, such as scales, intervals, and chords, provides a strong foundation for further learning.
-   **Practice regularly**: Apply music theory concepts to your own music-making and practice regularly to reinforce your understanding.
-   **Analyze music**: Listen to and analyze the music of others, paying attention to how they use different elements of music theory.
-   **Experiment and create**: Apply your knowledge of music theory to your own creative projects, experimenting with different styles and techniques.
