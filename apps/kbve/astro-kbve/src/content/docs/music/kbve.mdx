### Binary God

I am a binary god, codin my holy grail,
Digits dance in a trance, blazing a trail,
White lines mixin logic, my digital rails never fail,
Zeros and ones, I reign supreme in this fuckin realm,
My algos be flowin like rivers to hell, I'm at the fuckin helm.

I am a binary god.
zeros and ones, sum troll army of bums.
I am a binary god.
heros are none, rollin up to hell.
A prophets tale, Hades for my zale.
blood diamonds for your wife's tail.
I am a binary god.

dat prophet profits, I turn data into gold,
Machines keep learning, while your proteins keep unfolding,
Call my crows, I am your odin.

In the matrix, I'm the architect, castin divine,
Crafting futures, in this digital shrine.
I am a non-binary god.
