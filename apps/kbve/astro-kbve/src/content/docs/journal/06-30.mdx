## 2024

**DevCode**

We finished up migrating DevCode into the AstroPad but trying to convert the Shiki helper from a javascript file into a typescript was throwing way too many errors.
I will see if I can atleast convert the jsx and js files into a typescript tsx / ts but that might be a pain.


**Services**

Going to quickly create a bento grid component that would hold all our services.
The service page will just be hotlinks to our future shop.

The shadcn library integration with a couple other framer motion / r3f libraries within the astropad is the next move today.


**Fuster**

This is going to be the ultimate python library out there!
Hopefully this operation does not get discovered, its going to be a top secret library that will have the best haystack.
Actually, part of doing this is to get a better grasp at releasing python libraries, I was forgetting how I was doing it earlier today.

Starting with the Fudster library's migration of the secret, we want to make sure that we handle all secrets without any sort of problem.
The major difference between the `atlas` project and the `fudster` project is that one will run in a GUI format aka `atlas` , while the `fudster` library will run inside of a CLI?

Actually, as I am writing this out, it might make sense to swap those two? Damn I might have made a mistake.
The current error with publishing the fudster library was that our pypi token was not scoped to the right project, but since we will be building all our libraries out of the monorepo, this should no longer be an issue down the line.


**TitanFall**

The best way to handle build steps?
Play a quick round of titanfall ;D
Okay I am trash, damn I was getting killed left and right, oh well.


**Gunsmith Cats**

We should bring back the anime section!
There are so many amazing animes that we could provide *ways* to watch.

**Black Lagoon**

The best tv show to watch right after some gundam?
It has to be the lagoon!
I miss the characters, the music and the sounds.

## 2023
- 12:00pm - My legs are sore as fuck!
- 1:30pm - An interesting [docker image](https://github.com/Steam-Headless/docker-steam-headless/tree/master) for a small future side project, `Twitch Plays DF`. This docker image would run Steam within a Docker instance and let the GPU pass through, so ideally it would make it easier to manage the game instance. I am wondering if I could also automate the connection to the container, maybe using a combination of the Duck DNS and a reverse proxy.
- 3:30pm - Okay it looks like I am going to close out some of my positions and see if I can extend out my call options on TSLA, SPY and AAPL. 
- 5:30pm - Going to start migrating some of the ansible components into custom shell commands that can operate outside of Ansible, including the usage of Github Actions. This would extend out the CI/CD and it would help prevent vendor lock-in because it seems that Red Hat / IBM are doing some weird things with their open source software. 
- 7:00pm - I started to read up on the VuPlex concepts, so that I can integrate them at a basic Javascript level and then see if we can utilize them.
