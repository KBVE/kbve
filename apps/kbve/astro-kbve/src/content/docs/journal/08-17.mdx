## 2024

**Monkey Pox**
Just as we are preparing to go to Italy, there has been a rise in monkey pox cases and it would make sense to be a bit more prepared for it.
I think I will bring gloves and a bit of extra protection to make sure that we are safe during our travels.

**Flight**
Making a unique document with all the travel information and a smart checklist would be useful.
I will add it into another part of this site, maybe extend this out to a future travel collection?
I am still thinking if it would be worth expanding it out into its own folder or series of information, I guess I can write a bit and see the traffic stats over the course of the year.
Speaking of random parts of the website, I should continue to update the recipe section and add more unique styles!
While I am in Italy, I think it would make sense to go on a couple quests to find more interesting foods xD.

**DryCleaners**
Preparing everything with the dry cleaners was a bit of a pain because they did not have experience with cleaning and preparing indian outfits.
I had to plan around this issue and find a cleaner that was way too far from my house that could handle all eight outfits.

**Worker**
The next library that we want to release would be the worker library, which will take the place of `khashvault` and `db`.
We will be moving all the indexeddb actions into this library, but also extend it out to do websockets, sse and a couple more advance techniques.
The worker library will be deployed using this command: 

```shell 
pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib worker --importPath="@kbve/worker" --publishable=true
```

I was thinking maybe calling the library orc or ork for short? A bit of play on words for an Orc and Worker but I think we can move forward without it.

**Warcraft**
A great way to end a Saturday!
I might not be able to get my warrior up to lvl 60 before we have to go to another nation but I will gladly get it to lvl 85 once I get back.
A part of me can not wait for us to get really up there on the levels.





## 2023
- 5:45am - I had to get up early to fix up some of the issues with my roof's sun window? I am not too sure what they are called but there is a leak and honestly, the moment there is a roof leak, you know its going to be a problem down the line.

- 10:11pm - I will have to come back and update today's journal entry after the hackathon because it seems to be causing Astro to crash a bit.
