## Notes

## 2026

### Material Functions in Unreal

-   11:44PM

    Spent the day to get a better understanding of the material functions within the shader graph.
    I was not a major fan of it before, but I am starting to understand why it is being utilized.
    The whole custom params that get sent over to each instance makes sense because the GPU is what handles the rendering!
    If we were using the C++ directly, then we have a CPU cost for the rendering, so it would make sense that we pass that through.

### Unreal Fragments

-   11:47PM

    The fragment side of the cplusplus is also interesting, I been researching and getitng a better understanding of it.
    


## 2025

-   **GoDot**

    07:54AM

        After burning the midnight oil, I have gotten almost somewhere and yet no where at the same time?
        Ugh, okay here is the original toml, going to back up a bit and see what I can do to resolve some of these issues.

```toml

        [target.wasm32-unknown-emscripten]
        rustflags = [
            "-C", "link-args=-sSIDE_MODULE=2",
            "-C", "link-args=-pthread", # was -sUSE_PTHREADS=1 in earlier emscripten versions
            "-C", "target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory,+mutable-globals",
            "-Z", "link-native-libraries=no",
            "-C", "link-arg=-fwasm-exceptions",
            "-C", "link-args=-sSUPPORT_LONGJMP=wasm",
            "-C", "llvm-args=-enable-emscripten-cxx-exceptions=0",
            "-C", "llvm-args=-wasm-enable-sjlj",
            "-C", "link-args=-sDISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=1",
        ]

```

        That was the original toml, but I am going to back up and remove some of the flags that are there.
        Next going to replace this:
```
        "cargo +nightly build -Z build-std -Z unstable-options --target wasm32-unknown-emscripten --artifact-dir dist/wasm",
```
        With a bit of a better build?
        Okay wow, 151MB to 338KB.

-   **Music**

    10:58PM

        I decided it would make sense to move the music into its own component.
        Now we need to test the build and make sure that it works on itch.
        Okay the `DLL` for debug is around 283MB, but let us see what the size is for a normal release.
        Less than 1MB, we are good to go, yessir!

### 2024

    -   12:00pm - `WorkPlay`

        #### WorkPlay

            Tell me how I spent most of my time just AFK farming on Palworld while listening to random people talk in meetings.
            After a quick lunch break, I am going to take a quick nap and then focus on learning how to pipeline the Rust WASM.
            Now the question becomes, what should I have for lunch? 
            Honestly watching myself butcher a bunch of Palworld monsters... uhhh really did not make me want to eat anything meat related lmao.
            I will do quick greek yogurt smoothie and a spicy salad.

        
    -   4:00pm - `Apple`

        #### Apple

            It looks like I am going to be forced to sell a couple blocks of my Apple shares at around $190 each.
            At first, I felt that it might be a bit rough on my books to handle the sale, but majority of those shares were on margin.
            The net profit from the block sale should offset the interest that I was paying to hold those shares, but I really wish I had the script sell the shares for a bit more.
            I am currently looking at a way to do a combination of cover calls with poorman calls and a hail mary call.
                
                A poor man's cover call is basically a long dated call option, think 2025, that we then sell smaller dated call options against.
                A hail mary call is a really far dated call and strike, usually the goal would be to take advantage of stock price surges, which can easily net a couple points in the wallet.

            Granted these are just side notes for myself and makes it easier to organize the future hedgefund that is in my mind.
    
    -   11:00pm - `HerbWASM`

        #### HerbWASM

            I ended up missing my goal for the weekend, so I should focus on catching up on my own personal goals.
            I do not want to blame Palworld but having double digit hours does not help haha.
            Actually since the game came out, I am definitely past the 24 hour mark of playing the game, granted that does include some AFK farming.

            So there would be a couple scripts that we would would execute through the shell.
            The first would be the initial setup, so we would do:

            - [1] Trunk Setup -> `./kbve.sh -nx rust_wasm_embed:trunksetup`
            - [2] Trunk Release -> `./kbve.sh -nx rust_wasm_embed:trunkrelease`
            - [3] Herbmail Pipeline -> `./kbve.sh -nx rust_wasm_embed:pipe`

            After that we would need to pull the hash of the completed files, so that we can store them.

            So lets expand the pipeline to include the SRI hash of the files that get generated.
            We are getting the sha integrity from the produced files and the unique hash wasm variables.
