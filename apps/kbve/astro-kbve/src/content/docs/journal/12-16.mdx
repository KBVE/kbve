    **Sleep**

    What is sleep? That is the real question for tonight.

    **AStar**

    Doing more research for the unity plugin for astarpathfinder but I also have concerns about performance.
    Will the algo updating be fast enough on the webgl? Hmm, doing more research on that later tonight.

    **Fudster**

    For the fudster project, making sure that a different instance is spinned up and limiting the control only to specific user?
    This might be via uuid or I might find a way to handle that initially.

    **Proxmox**

    Going through the painful cycle of backing up each container and making sure that everything will run smoothly when performing the update.
    My bigger concern is that we might not have enough ram, so we need to make those adjustments.

    **Kubes**

    We just spent a bunch of time trying to get the kubes upgraded from version `v1.30.7` to `v1.31.3`!
    This included some issues with the backups, in which, the VM Worker 4 was just way too heavy or large to backup. 
    Past noticing that specific issue, I already know that we need a new machine to migrate our backups to but that requires me to go to microcity to get that arranged.
