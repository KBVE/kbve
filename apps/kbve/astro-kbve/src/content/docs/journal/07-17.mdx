## 2024

**State**
I had some really bad state management with the dialogue system that set me back a day but I am moving forward with the dialogue system.
The next step would be to organize and clean up some of the messages that get sent back and forth.
Afterwards, we want to see if we can add some custom font and maybe some sound effects for the different text that is being sent.
There was a point where I was thinking we would include a more dynamic setting, allowing more emotions to be displayed in the VN art style BUT I am thinking that should be on a later date.
We get the core of the system operational and then focus on the combat and gameplay!

**Dialogue**

We go some of the minor bugs fixed, now we need to split up the NPC response and the player base response.
Afterwards, we want to offer the different paths for which way the player wants to take the conversation.
Also there is a bug with the priority messages, it seems to be doing them in reverse.
I was able to update some of the flow within the text and yet there is still a decent amount of work that still needs to be done.

**Combat**

There are a couple ways that I want to handle the combat, the three major areas would be a jRPG, card style and a bullet hell.
Depending on the monster and situation, the player will be dropped into these three types of combat, keeping the game a bit more interesting than usual.
I was hoping the card style might be more towards a grander scheme, like town or nation management with the jRPG being more towards npc vs npc.
Finally, we could introduce the bullet hell concept when it comes to bosss or major fights?
The best way to move forward with this would be to create all three possible core scenes and then slowly build and abstract away from there.

## 2023
- 6:09am - It is an amazing Monday morning! The sweet and musky smell of the rain gives off a civil war-ish style vibe.
- 6:57am - I spent a bit too much time trying to get basic powershell scripts to work for RentEarth. I created two currently as `native.ps1` and `web.ps1`, one that runs expo for the mobile emulation and the other that runs the general webserver for the nextjs. 
- 10:37am - Migrating the state from React's state to the Nanostores state. i.e `() => tasker(status$, 'submitting')` while utilizing the tasker system. The idea would be to migrate a decent chunk of the state management / notification / variable system into the nano library. This will help improve performance and move some of the complex actions out of the main workflow. There could be a couple new issues that this might introduce, but for the most part, I think we should be able to manage them.
- 11:42am - Going through the Unity build setup so that it works on the Unity Devops. One of the issues to note would be that scenes might be referenced through their index number rather than a string. To resolve that issue, in the ASync loading of the scenes, it only accepts the string of the scene, however we have not yet migrated to that setup. There are some external notes for Unitask / Vcontainers that we could reference.
