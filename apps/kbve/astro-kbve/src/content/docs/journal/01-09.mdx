## Notes

## 2026

### Supabase Login for Handy Fork

-   11:15AM

    The Supabase login system will be similar to the oauth setup that we did with unity.
    I am thinking that it be wise to avoid the webview method, because it be better to just have it utilize single sign on.
    Later on, I could move all of that into a sidecar that will be a crate, then in future projects, I just load the sidecar.

### Vector Database for Handy Fork

-   01:59PM

    Currently looking at implementing a vector database for the handy application.
    Instead of it using our kubernetes vector setup, I want it to use a local embedded database.
    This should make it easier to manage and keep the costs of operations localized, rather than having to deal with the cloud.
    Moving as much of this into a local machine is the goal!


## 2025

-   **Helm**

    04:53PM

    Going to finish up the helm chart and then we can move forward.
    The `pydiscordsh-main.yaml` is almost done, we just need to fix the ingress.
    After finishing up the ingress and before the end of the night, I need to configure the sealed secrets.

```shell

        ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:seal --namespace=discordsh --keyName=discord-turso --secrets=""

```

-   **WoW**

    07:10PM

    Some quick hardcore afk game play!
    I am thinking that it will be a bit rough to do on the side, while still programming.

-   **Car**

    09:00PM

    Car battery should be charged!
    Went out in the cold, got some greek yogurt and everything seems charged.

-   **Deployment**

    11:52PM
    
    The deployment of `PyDiscordSh` is below:
    
    Repo: `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git`
    Branch : `dev`
    Paths: `/migrations/kube/charts/discordsh`

    There were some 503 errors but we were able to get everything wired!


## 2024

    -   3:03pm - `erust` library
        After test casing the `apps/rust_wasm_embed` , I want to move some of the `egui` functions into the `erust` library / packages / crate, so that I can use them in multiple applictions.
        The first module inside of the `erust` library will be the `ironatom.rs`.
        I will migrate some of the generic boilerplate into this module and test case the build from that aspect.

    -   4:16pm - `debug`
        I was able to split the application and library, now I am going to add state management inside of the `erust` library.
        During the debug stage, I went ahead and split the codebase up, as planned and started to build out widgets for the `erust` application.
        One of the next objectives would be to integrate some images into the WASM, including the background.
        I would like it so that the user has some integration settings but that might have to be done later on.

        Two additional libraries that I wanted to add were:
        `reqwest`, at version 0.11 and `image`.
