## 2025

### Sleep is Lost, damnjam.

-   06:00AM

    I am having a tough time keeping my sleep on point through this jam, I can feel myself getting older.
    The amount of hair that is thinning is way too high for this! 

## 2024

**Astro**

Looks like the new astro extension for nx v20 is almost ready to be push out!
Once we get that back into our repo and have it all be functional, we can move the project forward with some more updates.

**Postgres**

We have a couple updates to perform on the postgres instance, but before we do them, I want to make sure we can test case the live cluster migration.
The way that I am thinking of handling this would be through readme updates and having them be the point of activation for controlling the updates.
While gpt is converting over the different templates, I will start the new profile api for rust/herbmail.
I am thinking of calling it: `herbmail-profiles`, this should be a simple profile system that is based upon our supabase instance.

Okay, we were able to resolve the username uniqueness problem and that should be enough of an issue.
We did also make an adjustment to the select for the table, making sure that no one can pick out of it.

Ah wait there was a mistake on the sql query, we still want the user that is logged in to be able to select.
That was just us going a bit too extrememe on the security, oh well.

**Pizza**

The amount of pizza that I been recently eatting is just way too high, I just double checked my orders for the past three months and we had pizza like almost 10 times!
A huge waste of money for some extremely useless calories, ugh.
I also know that when I am home alone for a month, I will be eatting even more pizza, so I should double check my diet on those bad boy pies.

**KillTony**

Tonight is going to be another great tony episode, we got our old boi peters on stage.
I remember when his parents died and his comedy kinda flatline after his parents passed away.
Amazing episode! Yes and the ending, has to be Aris best joke so far, its definitely going to go viral lmao.
