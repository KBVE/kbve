## Notes

## 2025

-   **President**

    10:00AM

        The new president is taking office, well I guess not really new but it is what it is.
        I am wondering how the markets will react tomorrow, since they are closed today.

-   **GoDot**

    09:05PM

        Updating the rust ffi into the godot wasm build, going to try the first build and see where it goes from there.
        The reference issue that I was using is here [438](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext/issues/438).
        The target will be using a `-z` flag , so we need to setup the nightly.

        ```shell

        rustup toolchain install nightly
        rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
        rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten --toolchain nightly

        ```

        Next we need to add the emscripten to our WSL instance!
        For this, I created a custom script that we can invoke with `./tools/scripts/public/emscripten/install_emsdk.sh`.
        We also want to make sure that the rustup has a wasm32 nightly added `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten --toolchain nightly` 



### 2024

    - 5:40pm - `Holy`

        #### Holy

            One of the issues with the observer crate would be if we needed to include a Vec around the field object before placing it inside of the AtomicCell.
            There needs to be a bit more test casing and I believe that it would make sense to wrap it around the Vec, but I need to go through some real world test cases before I write it out.
            Besides the observer macro needing an updated AtomicCell with a Vec, the setter's notification has to be modified a bit. 
            Both of these issues can be resolved in a test case of the `rust_wasm_embed`.

    - 11:00pm   - `PalWorld`

        #### PalWorld
            
            Playing a couple hours of palworld and it has been great!
            Ended up building a massive base on Zachs server, while I been debugging the Crossbeam crate for an AtomicCell object.
            The game is still in early access but it has been very fun so far, the whole pokemone with guns is absolutely correct.
            I want to see what the end game content will look like and then explore the whole map, ah, collecting different pal monsters, it really is a trip down memory lane.

    - 4:00am - `Sleep`

        #### Sleep

            There was not much major progress today, it felt more like a break from the normal research and coding sessions, thus I will keep this entry short and sweet.
