### Redis XADD XREAD

-   01:02PM

    Time to update the protos to include the ability to XADD and XREAD aka Streaming!
    Since we have the fred crate, the streaming code is already in place and we just need to wire it up.
    The goal will be to shift all the binary over to another protobuf called RedisBinary or RedisStream, then just handle it like that.
    This means any binary that comes into the websocket would be treated as stream data and we can move the non-binary to the JSON commands.
    This should give us the best of both worlds without running too deep into issues.
    There would be room for improvements, we could also introduce a CapnProto later on too.
    Okay let me update the `redis.proto` within the Jedi package to include the Redis Binary stream!
    Afterwards we can update the redis wrapper to include the new stream data.

-   04:14PM

    After generating the new redis xdata streaming protos and adding them into the jedi crate, I am going to write them up on the rust side.
    The initial plan is to keep the basic redis commands within JSON, as stated earlier and I am just recapping my memory but we will process the binary first and in a different loop.
    New protos get converted to rust code using `./kbve.sh -nx jedi:proto` and afterwards we will import them to the `redis_wrapper.rs`.
    Now the fun begins with the functions!
    


### Unity Buffers

-   02:52PM

    We are currently building it around using json but once we get the basic debugging out of the way, we will just stick with binary.
    The goal might be to just serialize the NPC Manager and send it over the wire but that might not work either.
    Damn, multiplayer can become a pain to do the first round, I am thinking that it might be too much data that is moving back and fourth, ugh.
    I am getting a headache just thinking about it, gahhh.

## 2024

**Shrek**

I believe it is time to rewatch the whole Shrek series from start to finish!
Not just the three main movies but all the side movies!
I will become one with the shrek universe.

**DockerFile**

Oh let me swap the Ubuntu version to 22.04 and see if it works with that version!
Let us push the build up from this point and see if it works.


**Webmaster**

The webmaster tool has only a couple links for an average website owner, I am going through the notes and looking for any other additional tools to add into it.
Hmm, maybe afterward getting through the basics, we could add some special AI tooling? 
Like a tool that could go through the website and offer possible changes or improvements to the website?

**Legal**

The legal documents are still on the older template, I am going to swap them over to the new template.
Afterwards, I will still have to dive deep and replace some of the static content from the template system, which I been doing slowly.


## 2023

- Spent most of the day cleaning up and preparing my luggage for the trip back to India.
- Parker sent me this open source lawn mower, [Open Mower](https://github.com/ClemensElflein/OpenMower) and it really seems like a great idea down the line to look into. Imagine launching a landscaping business where you use robots to manage all the lawn care for your clients!
- AppWrite integration test casing is probably where I will spend most of my time today on. I ran into some issues with the GraphQL and sending out verification emails. It seems that Ezoic keeps removing our SendGrid CNAME / information, thus putting our emails back into the spam folder.
