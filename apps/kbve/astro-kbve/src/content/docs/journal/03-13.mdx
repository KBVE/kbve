## Notes


## Tasks

[X] - Finish Preparing Fish&Chip Pipeline


## 2025

### Kilobase v15.8.10

-   12:58PM

    Looks we solved that seg fault issue and we now have a very basic loading of the barebone postgres extension.
    I believe the next step will be to setup an additional unregulated worker that operates just outside of the postgres instance.
    This external worker will run with multiple threads under tokio.

### LoL Season 15

-   1:20PM

    Before diving deep into the realm of Rust, let me hit the spoon really quick.
    One of the worst games that I played in a while, so much feeding, ugh.

### RFC HiddenCut

-   03:31PM

    The dual cutlass on the rogue is definitely way too powerful, I am actually wondering if this will also make it easier to bring all my accounts up to the lvl 20 range.
    There are about 50 accounts that we can create for the hardcore and it would be great to start adding more spare accounts into the flow.
    Now there is another option but it will not be one that I will keep in the public notes, refer to the VIP.

### Foundation

-   04:25PM

    Episode one has been fantastic, this is going to be a great show, definitely holding me over until the next season of Andor.

### Solana Postgres

-   04:50PM

    Solana as a postgres extension will be my first web3 project in a long time, I remember using python to add information into the blockchain, time has been flyin.
    I think the next step will be to setup the external worker that will be able to handle the requests from the postgres extension.
    This will be a bit of a challenge but I think we can get it done.

## 2024

### FishChip

The focus will be back on making sure the NextJS build gets sent to the `kbve.com` folder via a build process.
The first command should build the script and then a pipe command should handle the cleaning up and replacement of the build.

Okay after thinking it through, we will have the beta branch build out the application and push it.

Under the `ci-alpha.yml` we had this code block:

```yaml

            -   name: React Fish & Chip Build
                  if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
                  shell:  bash
                  run: |
                        pnpm nx build react-phaser-fish-chip

            -   name: Upload Fish & Chip Build
                  if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
                  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
                  with:
                    name: build-FishChip
                    path: dist/apps/react-phasher-fish-chip

```

And instead of using the alpha branch, we will use the beta branch to build and pipe the final `nextjs` build.

Actually, we would be running the build through the KBVE action script instead of directly running the pnpm.

So the final command would look like this within the `ci-beta.yml`

```yaml

            -   name: React Fish & Chip
                if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
                uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                with:
                    flag: '-pipe react-phaser-fish-chip'
                    create_pull_request: false
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}


            -   name: React Fish & Chip
                if: needs.alter.outputs.reactfishchip == 'true'
                uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                with:
                    flag: '-build react-phaser-fish-chip'
                    create_pull_request: true
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                    pull_request_title: 'nextjs-react-fish-chip-built-request'
                    pull_request_body: 'NextJS Fish and Chip Built Request'


```

I will take a break from this for now!


### Jam

Time to prepare ourselves for another jam, which will include some planning and general scoping of the project!

I think the goal of doing 100 game jams as fast as I can would be an interesting way to become an indie game developer as fast as possible.

The amount of skills that I am lacking within the music and art field is also a bit sadage but I think we will be able to get through it, with time and friends, as they say.

Damn, I can already see a small game becoming born within the end of the year!


### Shogun

Caught up to episode 4 of the series, I am loving the cinematics and the character development so far!
I will try not to include any spoilers but FX is hitting it out the park with some of their new series, whoever is greenlighting them is doing a great job.
