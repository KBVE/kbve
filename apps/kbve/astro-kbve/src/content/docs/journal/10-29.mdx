    **KillTony**

    An amazing kill tony episode, it was a solid 6 out of 10.
    I was expecting their vegas set to be a bit more wild but the bucket pulls were really whack.
    Williams did a great job summarizing the whole set, it seems a bit bland and.

    **Login**

    Next, we want to make sure that login works for any account but I believe we will need to create a new method to handle that for us.
    In this situation, since its a new account, we would have to pass in the profile creation before we can do the `SafeLogin`.

    **Driver**

    The python script is throwing some errors but I believe it is because I am testing it on arm and not x86.
    So I will address them again tomorrow when I switch over to windows.
    We could setup the deployment of a dev atlas but that will be something that we can look into after we get the base of the `KBVEScript` running and operational.

    **Markets**

    The stock market is looking pretty good for the current situation and I am thinking that we can do a couple more plays before the end of the year.
    I am going to sell some call options against all my tech stocks, ideally only a week or three weeks out, then  with all that captial, I am going to buy some more REITs.
    If everything goes as planned, we are looking at around a net of $8000, which will be about another $70 a month for the rest of my life.
    That is on the lower end of estimates but hey, its a good play.

    **Apple**

    New apple products? Okay!
    The mac mini does look great but I am going to skip out on them and see if the older mac minis will drop in price because of this new one?
    I can sense a dope hack n tosh coming into my project bin sometime within the next three years.

    **Car**

    I am driving around and doing that roam and foam, a nice chai latte.
    Writing code while sitting on the bench was great for about the first half hour but damn its getting cold.
    I should plan on getting back home.

    **Night**

    My quick entry before the night!
    I go sidetracked by an amazing movie, American Psycho, but now I have to perform my own version of it within the binary realm.
