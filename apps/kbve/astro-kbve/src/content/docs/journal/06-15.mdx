## 2024

**NPM**

The joys of NPM!
We want to publish two packages by the end of this month, one being the `khashvault` and the other is `gha`.
Both of these are important in their own eco-system, just the small little errors here and there are taking a bit to process.

**Chess**

While we were talking on the Discord, a custom chess style game, where we can do 1v1 or 2v2 would be really fun to make!
A similar concept of autochess or autocombat blended into it the gameplay, taking a bit of that advance wars style gameplay too.
I can not wait to get back into game development, that itch needs to be scratched.

**KhashVault**

Yay! We were able to get the main khashvault released as a NPM package.
Yet there are still some errors that we need to fix, including the peer dependency.
Now the question is how would we go about doing it within Nx development cycle, and then we also need to get the `gha` library out there.

**GHA**

Okay! It seems we will have to go back around and update our external libraries, so that will be easier to build and deploy them.

In our case, we want to add the `gha` aka `github actions` library, so let us build out the basics of this lib.

```shell

pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib gha --bundler=vite --importPath="@kbve/gha" --publishable=true

```

This is the package json that we created for this library.

```json

{
  "name": "@kbve/gha",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A GHA helper library, providing better functions.",
  "keywords": ["github", "actions", "helper"], 
  "homepage": "https://kbve.com/application/javascript#gha",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git"
  },
  "author": "KBVE <hello@kbve.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {},
  "peerDependencies": {
  },
  "main": "./index.js",
  "module": "./index.mjs",
  "typings": "./index.d.ts",
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
}

```

It seems that the bundler being `vite` is throwing some errors that I do not think we need to debug.
Since this is the case, we could setup back and remove this library.


## 2023
- 9:00am - Will SPY keep going up? Damn I am printing money from these covered cash puts. I was hoping to grab an assignment yesterday when I was selling the $434/435 but it closed at $437.
- 10:0am - Going to take a quick break from the Internet and spend some time in the real world.
- 7:25pm - Stream Darts , the Always Sunny in Discord Edition. The concept is a high thought that we are test casing right now. The first duelist were @ziggy and @mrock, they did a rock paper scissors to determine who would go first.
- 7:57pm - The match is getting hot and heavy! As we cross intermission, @Ziggy is at 318 and @Mrock is at 225. Its been a close match but @Ziggy has been slowly gaining a massive lead over @Mrock. The crowd has been going `wild!`, almost as if they were infused with Alex Jones' special water.
- 7:58pm - Going to start the Webmaster react form from scratch again, hopefully I can get it out and ready by tonight. @Ziggy is now at 415 and @Mrock is 303! So close, and damn @Ziggy hits a 2, now at 417! @Mrock is closing in at 345!. OH NO! @Ziggy scores a double one, sitting at 419! @Ziggy wins with a 424! @mrock finishes with a 348! Great game boys!
