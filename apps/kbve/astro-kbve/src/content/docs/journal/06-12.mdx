**GitHub Actions Musical**

As the lack of sleep has been catching up to me, I think a musical called GitHub Actions would be amazing. It would be a bunch of robots making music, all controlled through github actions. Think about an animatronic character band that people can control via live stream and having it play to an audience that is all virtual? This is the next big thing, if KBVE ever has tech conferences, this is what we will do.

**Cookin Show**

A crazy cooking show idea would be where a couple funny guys have to make recipes that were generated by different AIs and some submitted by people. We would have to make the whacky food it suggests but also figure out if its AI or human, maybe a couple more twist and turns. This would be a weekly style show, kinda a cool way to show the advancements in ai but also a great live stream meme.

**Actions**

Okay, enough of these nutty ideas, let us go ahead and update the music process ticket to use our new actions. We are going to have some failures and a couple waves of main branch releases, ugh, I am not yet really ready for this.

I will go ahead and save myself some future typing and rename the action for issue ticket parsing to a short hand, making it easier for us to reference. I really hope these actions do not fail on us in the future, but I already get that spiderman sense running through my mind that there will be a bunch of failures.

While building out more of the github actions, I think it might be wise to do something creative and see if we can get Atlas up and running through github actions. This is just part of the test casing, hopefully jagspx launch goes as planned, but already had a couple failures in that area. We tried to grab the public ip address of the runner, yet that failed to certain extent but its good to know that we can grab that without any major problems. So the next idea is to throw up a ngrok and see if we can utilize that in our adventures, the first round of using it, uh, failed because I forgot to include the auth token. I believe in the future we should be able to just turn this into a new action, which I believe will be super useful!

While building that out, I am currently fixing up the comment action but its going to suck if all these new actions fail because we are missing some sort of logical library or a weird step.

**Python**

One of the other cool aspects of what we are building is that we should be able to even go as far as skipping a bulk of these current javascript issues and just run atlas directly inside of the github actions. I feel like having the javascript is really just a waste of resources and time but for this proof of concept, we will stick with javascript. However on my next rewrite, I will just run all of atlas, actually I might just run the whole damn docker image inside of an action and just have github handle it all for me, as if it was its own computer. Have it provide screenshots and everything! This first run is just to get the confidence to do some really whacky and crazy things later on. I am writing this all done so that I can reference it a year later and be like, damn I was right, these are some crazy times to be a programmer.

**SV**

Honestly watching Silicon Valley really puts me in the mood to grind out all night. Like I am not a huge motivation guy, but something about this tv show hits all those nerves and puts me into overdrive.

**RSPS**

We were able to get the base of the RSPS to launch through github actions! I decided to make this a different ticket.

It seems that ngrok decided to limit our transfer out, so we will have to replace that.

```yaml
# - name: Install ngrok
#   run: |
#     curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null
#     echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
#     sudo apt-get update
#     sudo apt-get install ngrok

# - name: Authenticate ngrok
#   run: |
#     ngrok config add-authtoken ${{ secrets.NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN }}

# - name: Expose Docker container with ngrok
#   run: |
#     ngrok http 3000 &
#     sleep 5 # Give ngrok a few seconds to start

# - name: Get ngrok URL
#   run: |
#     curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | jq -r .tunnels[0].public_url
```

That was our older ngrok, but I will make my own custom action using localtunnel and hopefully that will let us keep the rocket up until the moon!

It turns that localtunnel was also not good enough for this project, hmm, maybe I need to think a bit outside the box.
We could create our own ingress and then integrate that directly into our Rust API, or maybe we could spin it up as a different container that communicates with our API.

## 2023

- 11:00am - Waiting to transfer out a couple hundred grand from the recent sale of tesla stocks. I ended up exiting 600 shares and plan to transfer the move to another brokerage.

- 5:00pm - It seems that my grandpa's visa for India has some issues, so I shall try and resolve the issue as fast as I can. The documents requested are as following:

  - Medical Certificate
  - Request Letter
  - Undertaking Letter
  - Travel Document
  - Certificate
  - Minor Document
  - Visa
  - Others

- 5:45pm - I should further breakdown the different components but there are some additional steps that need to be done.

  - `Photo and Document(s) upload are mandatory`.
    - There are a couple file formats that they support, it seems to be mainly PDF and JPEG.
  - `Applicant must upload the photo before proceeding for appointment. `
    - We will schedule the appoint within the city of Vadodara
  - `Size of PDF document must be less than 200KB`
  - `Photo Requirements:` which extends into `Format - JPEG, Size: Minimum 10 KB and Maximum 1 MB.` They go further into detail about how the photo should be a passport photo with a `white background` with no cropping / shadows.

- 5:55pm - Quickly made a salad before I start to dive deeper into the full requirements. I will start with the `Medical Certificate`, which we already have, its in PDF format and is a total collection of all my grandpa's recent hospital checkups and doctor feedback. I think this collection should be enough under this requirement.

- 6:00pm - Next, I will tackle both of the letters, `Request` and `Undertaking`, by quickly looking up examples from the Internet. It is a shame that the Reddit blackouts are making it a bit more painful to search through, I had to resort to looking at the cache / older screenshots, but I suppose that means their protest method is definitely working. I was able to find this amazing website, [Indian E Visa](https://indiaevisas.org/indian-visa-extension-online-application/) that provides the perfect set of examples and samples to help navigate through this process.

- 6:15pm - Example of the Undertaking letter that I written:

  - `**I, Mr. Holy Byte, grandson of, Mr. Grandpa Byte, want to inform you about my grandfather holding passport No: 420696969. I am taking full responsibility for my father while he is recovering in India because of his current medical status. Thus, I am requesting immigration of India to approve his Indian entry tourist visa for 6 months.**`
  - I kept it straight forward and simple for now, as I do not think this will require much information/detail.

- 6:30pm - Next requirement was the `Travel Document`, which might be a bit confusing for me. I am under the impression that it is the Passport and/or plane ticket. I will email one of the tourist companies that I know and see what they say. Maybe it might be under the Form C? I guess I will have to look further into that area as well, I filled out this form earlier last week but I will do it again just to be safe.

- 6:40pm - Following that requirement is the Certificate, which I am going to assume falls under the Medical request / documents, in our situation, thus I will skip this as well as the minor document request. Finally the last remaining seems to be Visa and Others, thus it might be best to include any additional documents that I have within that relation. The specific office that we would be reporting to is the FRRO Ahmedabad, which is located `- Barrack No. 2, First Floor, Govt. Polytechnic Campus, Ambawadi, Ahmedabad,Gujarat-380015`. I never thought I would have to tell someone to visit a barrack within the polytechnic campus in real life but here we are.

- 9:50pm - Added an additional undertaking letter from my uncle. Hopefully these are enough documents to get this process going. I already emailed the Embassy and reached out to a local tourism agency for further support.

- 10:00pm - I forgot that someone, _cough_, made a script that automatically enters into class action lawsuits. Anyhow, that script is still running and someone may have gotten a recent check from that script. that person should make it into a weird side project / script for the future reference. Regardless there was a check from the `Celsius Class Action Settlement` and it was for an amazing total of $0.94! WoW!

- 10:25pm - The new windows server is up and running but there are a couple issues that I am already running into. The first being that docker is extremely slow and I am not too sure why! I really do not want to spend the time to figure out, it might be something to do with the drivers but the amount of time that I would have to spend is starting to look a bit tiring. Damn I am getting old.
