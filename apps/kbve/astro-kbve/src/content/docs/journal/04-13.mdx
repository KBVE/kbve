## Notes

## 2025

### RimWorldRun

-   08:40AM

    Taking a quick break from programming and resetting my mind, instead of league or warcraft, I decided to run a quick rim  world session.
    An interesting mod that I saw, called Multi Floors, has gotten my attention and it feels like its a great mod.
    My concern is that if the raiders that do land on my fort or if my older parts of the fort break, does my whole tower collapse?
    The goal of this run will be to see if I can take the whole thing down.

### Tax Man

-   10:31PM

    The worst feeling about April is uncle sam's visit!
    He is always looking at my pockets and waiting for his cut, ugh.


## 2024


### Castle

My cousin just recent opened up their new home!
The cost for this house was close to a million for them to build but it is massive, interesting and feels like a little mansion.
The project was called the `Castle of Edison` by the developer, because of how high the ceilings are and the amount of open space that the house presents.

They were able to fit about 100 people in there and from the outside, you could not even tell there was anyone one.

### War

The world seems to be just inches away from a global war. I do not have much to say about this feeling but it is looking closer towards becoming a dangerous eco-system across the different regions.

My fear is that it will escalate here within the southern regions of the Americas, once the threat is in our backyards, then the FUD is going to sky rocket.

### Ubuntu 24

With the recent annoucement of Ubuntu 24 LTS beta, it will be time to slowly migrate everything from the QEMU/KVMs and Dockerfiles to GHAs/Gitlab actions.
This will be a rolling update that we

### DockerFile

The current plan is to split the Dockerfile for ATLAS to focus on building out the core functions, VNC, python 3.12, x11 , ect... then shift the setup to an `entrypoint.sh`.

In case anyone runs into an error like this: `ERROR: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

Open `Docker Desktop`, go to `Settings` > `Resources` > `WSL INTEGRATION` , then make sure that `Ubuntu` is selected. 

Incase we run into an issue where `Poetry` cannot be found, we can set the path for it within the `Dockerfile`:

```
# Ensure the Poetry bin directory is in the PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:${PATH}"
```

The amount of hours that I have spent going through different options and debugs! Ugh!

Next error on the dockerfile build:

```

```

Okay! Next error is debug 44, but we are making progress in the setup!
We have the ubuntu container built out, fixed a formatting issue within RSS Utility and we were able to connect to the container on the noVNC web panel.

For Debug 45, we are going to update the entrypoint script once more because of a black screen / display error.

```

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    wget \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    x11vnc \
    dbus-x11 \
    xvfb \
    xauth \
    tightvncserver \
    novnc \
    net-tools \
    python3-tk \
    python3-dev \
    gnupg2 \
    gnome-terminal \
    gnome-session

```

We are also going to add `dbus-x11` package inside of the Dockerfile.

Yay! We got the Docker application to run with display and the terminal window!
Making progress! Now we want to update the FastAPI that is running within this contianer to proxy our noVNC.
