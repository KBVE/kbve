## Notes

Testing out the journal entries for 2024!

I will have to make this section a bit more unique later on but for now it seems great.

## 2025

### Post Office

-   04:30PM

    Had to quickly run to the post office and make a money order but now I am thinking about it.
    Could we deposit those money orders through a mobile app? 
    Hmm, I am going to do a bit more research on it, because it feels annoying at first but as I am selling stuff, I need a way to handle the money.
    I rather not have to count the cash.

### HUD

-   08:57PM

    Updated the icons for the HUD and now we have two major parts to finish up for tonight.
    The first will be the game's background and the second will be saving the games state.
    Hmm, let me break down the order of things that need to be done.
    
    -   Game's background.
    -   Saving and loading of the player stats.
    -   Replacing the spaceship sprite.
    -   Fixing the asteroid splitting and replacing those assets with better ones.



## 2024

### NX

I spent a decent amount of time rebuilding the NX Smartrepo pipeline, we were able to get updated to version 18 but it seems that the Rust plugin was throwing errors.
We had to downgrade the Rust plugin from the version of 1.3.3 back to version 1.2.X, which was able to then build and run without any problems.
The plugin upgrade was causing a null point error within nodejs, thus causing the whole pipeline to break!
It seems that I can never get away from null point errors, even in RUST! just kidding, it was all nodejs bullypoopy.


### KBVE

Going to update the template a bit more while the pipelines are building.

Added a dual layer to the footer, so that there is a static one at the bottom with more information and a floating footer that provides the legal information.

Next component to add into the template is the MDX hero that we had in the older KBVE.com repo.
Maybe I should rewrite it again, because it seems to be the common thing that I been doing throughout this whole project.

I decided to make an extraction engine that would help with the default information!
There are a couple things that I still need to resolve but this should help with creating abstracted content throughout the application.


### PackageHell

It seems that I had entered package hell because of the amount of dependencies were all over the place, some of them not published, causing a weird vendor loop.

Nx Graph kept looking for version 0.1.2 of `holy` but the workspace had a version of 0.1.3, which caused a weird bug in the graphing system.

We will downgrade the Rust NX integration back to a working state for now, so we can move on.


### RustWASM

Running the Rust WASM is currently with this command:

-   `./kbve.sh -nx rust_wasm_embed:trunkserve`

I already updated the ReadMe with the command, incase I forget in the future!
