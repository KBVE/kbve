### Zombie Horde Mode

-   04:07AM

    We got the spawning down into the different horde squads, we just need to make the adjustments on how they will move around the map.
    There are a couple other things we need to include, but that will be for the map itself too, which is another phase in this ECS adventure.

## 2024

**Kilobase**

Already 2am, oh man, the time seems to fly when trouble shooting through kubernetes.
The goal will be to get the majority of the postgres operational but there are a room full of errors that we need to resolve on the side.
The kong settings need to be adjusted a bit for the wrapper.sh and the functions, which I will start while waiting for the build to move forward.

- 2:26am

The current error is that it wants to pull the `15.1` image of kilobase, but we released a specific image called `15.1.1`.
Maybe the issue might be because of cache, regardless, going to go back and switich the pull to Always for now and then see where it goes from there.
Actually, we could also update the image tag and make it publish with a `15.1` and the `15.1.1`.
In this case, we will do both and see where it goes from now, going to push out this branch and create a new branch.

- 3:19am

There seems to be a mismatch between the usermod for the postgres, so I am going back and switching it back to the way that Supabase had it, which was 101 for postgres.
We will bump it up to version `15.1.2` but still release it under `15.1`, but I wonder if that will cause problems, hmm.
Lets bump up the chart version too, maybe that will help with the current situation.

- 4:42am

Progress has been made, we were able to get the initial databases up and running, but there is still some issues with the other functions unable to connect.
Going to have go back around and updated all the `DB_HOST` values to be our kubernetes value.

- 4:57am

The function container aka edge container seems to be throwing an error because of the read-only file system, so let us go ahead and update it so that it can write the cache.
Under its `values.yaml`, we will go ahead and update the function setting, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: false`, which should now let us write.
One error after another, lets get this going, going to do it for all of them.
The other idea would be to just fork each of the images that supabase has and make the file changes we want, then publish them as our own images.
This way we can then force them to be read-only, but that will be way later on in the system.
Getting closer to the goal, with 35/41 resources running.

Updated the configmap with everything else we might need! Lets hope that it will solve our issue and get this baby closer to operational.


**Worker**

Expanded the worker5 sda3 to 50GB and now I am thinking of looping back around and expanding all the remaining VMs in the master series.
Adding another 18Gb to each of the masters would help with the images that we are pulling and should give us a bit more room to be flexible.
In the future, with our next worker6 and worker7, we can give them a decent bulk size but that will require some additional planning to pull off.
We did a quick resize to all the 5 original nodes.

**Markets**

What a rebound in the markets, good to see the post fed rates finally starting to give that much needed boost back to infinite.
We just need nvidia to come back into that $125 zone and we are officially printing bags.

**SQL**

- 12:40pm

The biggest issue that we have is in the configmap for the post install, which I am thinking we could resolve with our own SQL statements afterwards.
The current idea would be to isolate these additional sqls into their own configmap and then appy them afterward the main init.

- 4:00pm

It seems that the `$PGUSER` and the `$PGPASS` are reserved for the operator, so we have to remove those from the `env`.
Thus we can switch back around and update the `kilobase-additional-sql-postgres` with references to those two variables, now I wonder if the `$JWT_SECRET` will still pass through.
Going to delete the fleet that we just deployed and start the whole process again.

```SQL


    -- migrate:up 99-jwt.sql
    ALTER DATABASE postgres SET "app.settings.jwt_secret" TO '{{ .Values.secret.jwt.secretRefKey.secret }}';
    ALTER DATABASE postgres SET "app.settings.jwt_exp" TO '{{ .Values.db.environment.JWT_EXP | default "3600" }}';

    -- migrate:down

    -- migrate:up 99-logs.sql
    CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS _analytics;
    ALTER SCHEMA _analytics OWNER TO '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.username }}';

    -- migrate:down

    -- migrate:up 99-realtime.sql
    CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS _realtime;
    ALTER SCHEMA _realtime OWNER TO '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.username }}';

    -- migrate:down

    -- migrate:up 99-roles.sql
    -- NOTE: change to your own passwords for production environments
    ALTER USER authenticator WITH PASSWORD '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.password }}';
    ALTER USER pgbouncer WITH PASSWORD '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.password }}';
    ALTER USER supabase_auth_admin WITH PASSWORD '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.password }}';
    ALTER USER supabase_functions_admin WITH PASSWORD '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.password }}';
    ALTER USER supabase_storage_admin WITH PASSWORD '{{ .Values.secret.db.secretRefKey.password }}';

```

These are the SQL statements that we will have to manually execute on the container to get the rest of the instance up and running.
Afterwards we can run barman and see if it moves the database into the s3 bucket as a backup.
If the WAL and the DB get saved to the s3, we can deploy it all again but with a recovery mode, then that should be enough to handle our generic needs for now.

**Meta**

The meta data issue that I am facing is:

Failed to create resource: admission webhook "vcluster.cnpg.io" denied the request: 
Cluster.postgresql.cnpg.io "kilobase-migrations-kube-charts-kilobase-supabase-supabase-db" is invalid:
metadata.name: Invalid value: "kilobase-migrations-kube-charts-kilobase-supabase-supabase-db": the maximum length of a cluster name is 50 characters

We could try to scale some of the names back to help with the deployment.

## 2023
- 9:35am - I woke up a bit late today and I think I am going to go back to sleep a bit more, I need to catch up on my ZZZs.
- 5:03pm - Okay there are a couple things that I need to overlook when it comes to handling the YoRHa UI, but the issues are still a bit of a pain.
