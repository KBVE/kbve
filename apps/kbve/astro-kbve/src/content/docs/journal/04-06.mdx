## Notes

Prepare the side account for the IRS bill.

## 2025

### Fred BB8

-   07:04PM

    While I was refactoring the redis wrapper to use a thin linear layer, I came to the understanding that it would make sense to swap out the bb8.
    Replacing the bb8-redis and redis crate with the fred crate because it solves a decent amount of the issues that those two previously could not.
    Each rewrite, puts us further back in the timeline but it improves the stability and understanding for the long term.
    I suppose this is the rough part of rust, having to refactor over and over.
    Thus, the next refactor after this refactor will be to use flexbuffers and binary.

-   08:17PM

    One of the changes with this refactor will be taking out the bb8 pool system and using a multiplex from fred.
    I understand this but it does feel a bit weird to do.
    We will have to do it again when we updated Postgres to version 17 on the Supabase image.
    In a normal pool, we would have multiple connections and use a borrowing method for each of the connections within the pool.
    Hmm, I will have to write this out a bit more and maybe it might fully click.

-   09:31PM

    Updating the temple state, hmm.
    Dropping the `pub redis_pool: Pool<RedisConnectionManager>` and replacing it with a redis client from the fred crate.
    Wait, I was confused on the whole pool concept, but I think I understand it a bit more.
    

### The Wheel of Time

-   09:25PM

    Season 2 of the Wheel of Time is turning out to be even better!
    This series better not go the way towards of Game of Thrones.

## 2024


### DreamBound

Preparing the docker build for the DreamBound platform and the state management within the structure.
We had to move all of Erni's codebase from this repo into the `kbve` repo, but did not get a chance to refine and process the codebase.

Part of the code migration was a bit of a pain because of the typescript safety, however we were able to convert and ready most of it.
The next step would be to make sure everything gets wrapped into a single docker Image.

For the `dev` cylce, we will be using this command: `./kbve.sh -nx express-colyseus-discord:serve`.

As for the production image, we will be running `./kbve.sh -nx express-colyseus-discord:build:production --export`.

Going to go ahead and push these changes through, as the most recent build had a failure.
I am thinking the build failed because we had two additional files that we did not need, so lets see if that was the case.


### Food

The best meal that I had today was a classic maggi soup made by my aunt!
The taste of India hit all the notes that I was look for, savory, sweet, spicy, ect... there could be a food truck that only sold this meal and it would make thousands a week.
