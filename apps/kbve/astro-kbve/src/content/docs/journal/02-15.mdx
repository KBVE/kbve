## Notes

## 2025

### MacOS Guards

-   04:58PM

    I feel bad that I forgot I could just rewrite the ffi module imports as a target grouped guard.
    The way that we would do it is like this below, rather than having to place the target line-by-line.

```rust

#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
mod my_mod_name {


}

```
    Going from one language to another to another is getting a bit annoying.
    Hopefully we do not have to do any javascript today and just get the web browser imported and ready.

### American Gangster

-   11:30PM

    Just finished the whole 3 hour long movie and it is a straight 7 out of 10.
    The movie was filled with so much information, I am going to have a rewatch of it again after I finish all of the Wire.
    Each part of the film introduces a complex short story that could be adapted into its own film, like an onion, layers upon layers of detail.

### Godot Wry Windows

-   11:37PM

    As engaging as the film was, half my brain was looped into the unsafe wry world of browsers.
    This upcoming push will aim to have both a Windows and MacOS native browser that I plan to utilize for a customish webview.
    For linux, I am not too sure what the best option would be for this time period and the WASM builds will just be using Javascript FFI.
    Speaking of which, I have to loop back around and fix the unity javascript ffi too, ugh. 

## 2024

### Trees

Spent a bit of time building the tree cel shader!

There are a couple steps that I am learning about, including the materials, image formats and how to apply them to different objects.

Right now the bigger issue is figuring out the base three colors for the leaves and the bark.

### Pipeline

I am going to reactive the pipeline because it seems that our art style and the models that we would be using are smaller than what I expected.

The plan was to disable the alpha builds while we get the annex up and running but if the models are small enough, I think we can get creative enough with the tools that we have.

I suppose we shall see once we build out a couple levels.

The way to active the build would be to set the conditional line / variable to true.

```yaml

run: "::set-output name=build_unity::true"

```

This line will be our switch, so let us test it out!

Okay it seemed to be an error, let me try to run a bash shell to set the output?

```yaml

jobs:
        setup:
            name: "Setup"
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            outputs:
              build_unity: ${{ steps.set_output.outputs.build_unity }}
            steps:
              - id: set_output
                shell: bash
                run: |
                    echo "build_unity=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

```

We still need to test this pipeline but I also need to push through the remaining models.

### GitLab

I decided to begin building out a hybrid gitlab, one that will be hosted on gitlab.com directly, just incase we run into an issue with Github, and then another repo that will be our private one.

The goal of having additional repo locations is to avoid any issue with github, ideally making it so that the cicd pipeline is git agnostic.

The private gitlab instance could be a docker instance or a kubernetes setup, I am not too sure yet but I will write out a couple plans that we can use.
