## Notes

## 2026

### Handy TTS and LLM

-       12:02AM

        Adding basic support for the LLM and TTS for the handy fork!
        The goal would be so that it can listen to what I am saying, turn it into text.
        After it gets the text, we need to feed it to a LLM for parsing!
        We could have the LLM be part of the core application, trying to keep it all offline ready.
        Yet, there should be some functions that would allow us to call the cloud LLM providers?
        Finally after getting the response, we would need to do a text to speech.

### Riot API Integration

-       12:46AM

        We could also integrate the game client, i.e league and have a quick text model?
        Let us imagine playing league, then having comms that would allow us to ask questions related to the game.
        I could ask what items that I should buy, it would look at the stats and determine the best item?
        For example it could respond back if I am going tank, support, damage and then determine the best option for the player.

-       03:16PM

        The LCU seems to be straight forward and does not seem to require any major abstraction.
        So we play the game and have it listen to when we connect, then just go from there?

### Books of Tauri

-       5:54PM

        The core lore could be around three books and having their locks be important.
        Book one opens the second book, while the key of the 2nd book opens the third.
        This way have this chain among the books, allowing them to act like runes or scrolls?
        I am still working this out, such that it will make sense.

### Full Action Plan for Handy-Like Clone

-       08:28PM

        These are the core parts that the application will need:
        1. Adding Discord support.
        2. Adding VectorDB / or database with vector support.
        3. Adding League support. We can connect to the LCU and get information from a league match that is being played.
        4. Adding supabase login via OAuth, we can re-use the KBVE API that RentEarth is also utilizing.

## 2025

-       **Rancher**

        05:56PM

        Something went wrong with the rancher certs and I was able to figure it out by going through the issue tickets.
        I believe the issue was that when we updated rancher, it might have reset the certs but we were able to make sure that ACME / LetsEncrypt does its job.
        After going through some casual walk through with ChatGPT, we were able to solve the issue.

-       **Secrets**

        06:58PM

        We need to update the Sealed secrets once more and then enable the `discord` namespace to have access to the `service_role`.


```shell

        ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:seal --namespace=supabase --keyName=supabase-secret-jwt --secrets=""

```

        Going to recreate the secrets here and then move forward, making sure that the `service_role` has the right key.
        After using the jwt decrypt, I think we put the wrong service key in the seal!
        Once we update the sealed secret, I will add another seal inside of the new `discordsh` namespace, which will then grab that information and use it.
        Our goal would then be to migrate some of the user-defined functions directly to the supabase, including the JWT/Auth.

-       07:32PM

        **DockerHub**

        Next on the agenda will be to add in the dockerhub image for DiscordSH!
        After it gets added, we can move forward with building out the helm chart and we should be good to go!
        That was a quick fix to the docker build, next we want to prepare the discord shell build.

## 2024

- 2:31pm - erust

  - Preparing for the crate creation of `erust` , which will hold the `egui` / `eframe` library.

  - The command that we will run to create the library will be like this:

        ```shell

        pnpm nx g @monodon/rust:library erust

        ```

  - After creating the base library known as erust, we will now create the application that will utilize the erust library.

        ```shell

        pnpm nx g @monodon/rust:binary rust_wasm_embed

        ```

  - Make sure we are up to date with rust, by running this in our shell:

        ```shell

        rustup update

        ```

  - Followed by adding our egui dependencies and migrating the generic `eframe_template` files over to the `apps/rust_wasm_embed`.

- 5:02pm - Bug Wars

  - We will first focus on getting the general build out of the way for the `apps/rust_wasm_embed` and focus on tackling any bugs that might appear.

  - I believe I would also have to setup the `Trunk` for the build and also need to add the rustup targets.
    These will be added into the `Rust` docs tomorrow.
