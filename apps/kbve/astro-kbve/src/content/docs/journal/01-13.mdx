## Notes

## 2025

-   **WoW**

    03:40PM

        Time to level up the mage!
        My plan is to get the mage quickly to level 16 or so and then switch over to the warlock.
        Maybe I could run some quick ragefire once docker desktop closes up.

-   **Supabase**

    05:37PM

        I finished up the discord tags earlier at night.

## 2024

    -   1:40pm - `readme`
            I am going to rewrite the readme for the monorepo, maybe make some minor changes to how I am presenting this monorepo?
            There are some styles that I wanted to incorporate into the `Readme` but I will try to do it slowly, without going too crazy.

    -   4:25pm - `erust`

            #### Erust

                Time to clean up the `erust` library and prepare it for the next version.
                So we need to replace the `applicationstate.rs` with a modular state system, however we might need to create a whole new crate.
                The new crate would be for proc-macros that we could utilize in the future for additional crates, like `kbve`. 
                Sometimes making libraries can become a pain, but I suppose that it will help my future self.

    -   8:04pm - `issues`

            #### issues
            
                I am going to spend some time going over the issue tickets and maybe creating a couple new ones to help me keep track of the changes.
                I do want to add a couple GHA / Github Actions that would help create, manage and even respond/answer the issue tickets later down the line.
                The idea would be to slow drip the mL integration into the monorepo, hopefully not causing too many issues down the line.

                - [502](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/502) - Issue 502 will be for the Script Migration.
