## 2025

### CC Bills 2025

-   01:00PM

    Before I go out to grab some quick food and goodies, I need to make sure that everything is squared for the end of the month!
    We want to make sure that everything is paid for and that the cash surplus is extended out further than the 15k mark.

### Bytes

-   02:02PM

    Rewrote all of the redis functions to be lifetimes but ended up going back.
    Nothing is worse than rewriting your whole rust eco-system, only to have to revert it because you decided to use a crate instead of rolling your own.
    Each time I roll my own internal system, I remember that it might not be worth it because then I have to maintain that system!
    Not everyone can be the tanstack guy xD.
    After adding the bytes and making sure that it builds, we can handle the nested streaming within the websocket.

-   06:45PM
    
    Updating the redis_wrapper.rs to include a bunch of additional helper functions and utility calls, eventually rewriting them in the future into a chainable object?
    Part of this exercise is to treat it like a set of light weights, where we keep lifting and placing it down, slowly adding more weight as we get better.
    The issue that I am seeing right now is that we are trying to have both the JSON and Binary within the same websocket.
    That connection could either return valid JSON or Binary.


## 2024

The main focus will be getting the launch ready for KBVE website and application.
Ugh the account page is still super buggy, but I think we can still move foward with the way it looks, at least in our initial launch phase.

**About**

Going to make changes to the about page, and testing some of the code generation via offline models.
Honestly they are getting way better than I expected.

**KILLTONY**

Always a great way to start off the mondays!
Another addition to the collection, the show was a solid 6/10!
Some of the acts were really bad but overall, it was a solid episode, damn tony hawk lookin old.

**Invoice**

I am preparing the invoice management and generator, making it easier to keep track of all the records and services.
This is going to be a bit tough to mix in the old code with the new code, but I think we can get somewhere decent with it by the end of May. 

## 2023

Pre Launch has been pushed back over and over!
While it sucks to have to delay the MVP, it is great to see the backend and frontend stack evolve and become more mature.
I think Astro still has a long way to go but so far I have been impressed and amazed with how fast it has grown.
