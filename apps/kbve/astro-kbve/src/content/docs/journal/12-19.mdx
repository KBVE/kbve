    **API**

    Time to remove the older source code for the first kbve api, since we need to slowly take drizzle out of the eco-system & packages.
    Once that is completed, we can update the expo and tamagui libraries!

    **NX**

    Upgraed nx to 20.2.0 and some of the smaller plugins!
    I also decided it was time to remove the last parts of drizzle, since that ticket has been open for way too long.
    Let me delete the final config and call that part of it a rest.

    **Repo**

    Cleaning up some of the older unity rareicon examples for unity 6 and some nx-go parts.
    We will just clear that up right now so that we can move forward.
    Also removing some of the last of the C# lingerring applications.

    **Kanban**

    The next goal would be to get the init kanban setup, including the database entry and the ability for basic CRUD.
    I am thinking that we do an init kanban and work around that for now.

    **Raspberry**

    Just got the rpi 8gb model and now I am going to try and figure out a way to get that damn.
