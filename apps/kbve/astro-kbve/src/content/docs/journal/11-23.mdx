    **Rareicon**

    The plan is to develop a semi-complex build for our discord deployment of the WebGL build.
    The best approach would be to isolate each aspect and go deeper than a micro service style, we are going cell.
    With that being said, maybe we should watch DBZ too, just to help get the blood flowing.
    In the action, we can create an isolated one that would upload the finished webgl game to the new repo under the docs folder.

    **Unity**

    The session went great and I gotten more experienced with the pool system.
    I am going to try and finish up this webgl build tonight, hopefully we can get the remaining docker build up by tomorrow night too.

    **Clockwork**

    I remember watching bits of this movie a long time ago and just never understood it.
    Rewatching it now, its actually really based and interesting, especially for the time period that it was made.
    The creativity has aged so well too.
