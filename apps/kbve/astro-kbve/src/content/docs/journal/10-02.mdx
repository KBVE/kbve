import { Adsense, Tasks } from '@kbve/astropad';

## 2024

**Dashboard**

To grab the dashboard password for quick development work!
This is just a note for myself in the future.

```shell

kubectl get secret supabase-secret-dashboard -n supabase -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode

```

Yesterday, I added two base schemas and now I want to test them out!
We still need to update the dashboard's logging connections, as it is unable to see the auth logs and a couple other areas.


**Extensions**

While testing out the schemas for Supabase, I need to wrap back around and finish up the Redis extension for KBVE.
Part of the reason that I hate working on it is because if it fails then I have to go through a multi-stage recovery process, ugh.
The big issue we had last time was passing of the sealed secret but I believe that was just a mistake on my end with the permissions and nothing related to the code.

**CNPG**

Updated the `sql.mdx` notes with the CNPG Backup.
The rolling recovery still needs to be tested but I think we can find a creative way to help us handle that.

**MDX**

To help with the build of `kbve.com`, I had to go through all our `MDX` references and remove them.
Furthermore, I had to remove some of the deadcode that was lurking around all our monorepo.
It was over 400 files that I had to change and fix today, what a wild ride!
