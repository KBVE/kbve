    **Logger**

    The first change we can make is creating a new logger for the `KBVEScript`, which we will call for the logging but allow it to send the message out to the FASTApi.
    This is just a minor tweak that we will need to do.

    **Example**

    Okay we are able to set the world!
    This is great, making some progress in the terms of websockets, yessir!

    ```json

    {
            "channel": "default",
            "content": {
                "command": "execute",
                "packageName": "net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.util.security",
                "className": "Login",
                "method": "setWorld",
                "args": [308],
                "priority": 1
            }
    }

    {
            "channel": "default",
            "content": {
                "command": "execute",
                "packageName": "net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.util.security",
                "className": "Login",
                "method": "Login",
                "args": ["myUsername", "myPassword", 301],
                "priority": 1
            }
    }


    {
            "channel": "default",
            "content": {
                "command": "execute",
                "packageName": "net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.kbve",
                "className": "KBVEScripts",
                "method": "AcceptEULA",
                "args": [300, 301],
                "priority": 1
            }
    }

    {
            "channel": "default",
            "content": {
                "command": "execute",
                "packageName": "net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.kbve",
                "className": "KBVEScripts",
                "method": "AcceptEULA",
                "args": [755, 490],
                "priority": 1
            }
    }

    ```

    **DoS**

    Almost knocked my whole docker image offline by creating a wild dos websocket attack, where it kept looping back and fourth xD.
    Yeah we will have to figure out the multiple channels or multi socket setup.
    There should be a better way to handle the errors, hmm.
    For safety reasons, lets go ahead and add a quick button to start and stop the runelite client.

    **Coords**

    Okay based upon the screen size of the window being launched, we need to adjust the client so that it launches not in full screen.

    ```json
    
    {"command": "execute", "packageName": "net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.kbve", "className": "KBVEScripts", "method": "AcceptEULA", "args": [755, 490], "priority": 1}
    
    ```

    **Dockerfile**

    Updating the dockerfile so that the new applications open in a normal window mode.
    We can accomplish this using the `NO_FULL` env and that should help with the scaling issue.
    After fixing that error, I am moving towards trying to figure out how to best handle profiles aka login.
