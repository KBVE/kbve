## 2024

**MTG**

Meeting up to play my trump deck!
I did not get a chance to turn it into a commander deck, but I will do that in June!
Ugh, summer is already here? Time is moving way too fast.


## 2023


- The time stamps are a bit messy for this note because there were a couple failures during the migration to the newer journal system. 
- The Asynchronous loading seems to be working fine within our first test case inside of Unity but it automatically replaces the cut scene window. So I am thinking we need a button within the loader that the user presses again to go to actually enter the level, I am thinking of calling it `Skip` or `Next` which will be disabled initially on load and then enabled once the asynchronous function has loaded the next scene. 
- Besides spending time on the Unity project, I decided to go back into the rs project which I believe I will go ahead and end for the time being. I will return to that aspect once I get a couple concepts clear up from my plate. I believe that I am spreading myself a bit too thin for the current amount of work and backlog.
