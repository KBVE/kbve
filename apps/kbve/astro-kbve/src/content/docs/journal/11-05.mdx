### Burn Shader Effect

-	11:30AM

	After a card is used in a combo, we should make sure that there is a cool effect that happens.
	I am thinking that we have the card burn via a direction, maybe at random.
	Then we make sure that the different shader effects are removed as we place back into the pool.

	**Docs**

	Decided to make a quick repo for the microbot community.
	It was a great refresh for operating inside my own repo without having to deal with a monorepo?
	Without that extra layer, it does make things so much easier to build and quickly deploy.

	**Election**

	The day of the year is finally here and I can not wait until the day is over.
	There is going to be a nice release of all that political gunk stuck in everyones mind, its post election nut clarity.

	**Supabase**

	Table structure is currently:
		-	`user_cards`
		- 	`user_cards_public`
		-	`user_profiles`

		With the `user_cards_public` being a materialized view, so we will not have to worry too much about it.

	Trigger structure, there are two areas that we need to process for the triggers, the `auth` schema and the `public` schema.
	Under the `auth` schema, we only have the `on_auth_new_card_created` trigger active but that will be disabled in this next query.
	The bigger concern will be under the public schema, where we have 4 more triggers!
		-	`handle_user_card_update` - under table `user_cards` with function `handle_user_card_update`
		-	`handle_user_cards_update` - under table `user_cards` with function `moddatetime`
		-	`handle_user_profile_update` - under table `user_profiles` with function `handle_profile_update`
		-	`handle_user_profiles_update` - under table `user_profiles` with function `moddatetime`

	Finally we have the database functions, which are split into into the two schemas again, `auth` and `public`.
	Under the `public`, we have:
		-	`before_insert_hcaptcha_verfication` with 0 arguements, a return type of trigger and security of invoker.
		-	`create_user_profile` - with `_username` as text, a return type of void and a security definer.
