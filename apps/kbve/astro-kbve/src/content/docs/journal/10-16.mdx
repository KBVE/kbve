## 2024

**Astro**

Looks like the migration to a functional v20 nx instance is almost done, however the astro extension seems to fail to execute.
There is already an issue ticket of the problem in the extension repo, so we will just keep track of it and wait to see what the authors do to resolve it.
I am thinking that it will be an easy fix, the error is most likely because of a variable change but I did also notice that in v21, the tasks will be removed?
The best bet would be to wait it out for a week or so, and then 


**DotNet**

I made the decision to remove the dotnet 7 / dotnet 8 direct support because too many issues within my mac and wsl instances.
Since we are having our unity repos now sit outside of the monorepo, we can just move towards removing the dotnet library from our monorepo.
This will be officially done within the next month, we will still keep the the unity packages within our monorepo but not a whole unity game.

**Kilobase**

Trying to resolve the redis extension for the build, but I know that it will be a pain to work through the code again.
We want the kilobase extension to grab the data that gets placed into a table, aka the start of the redis code.
I moved this part of the entry to the 10-17.
