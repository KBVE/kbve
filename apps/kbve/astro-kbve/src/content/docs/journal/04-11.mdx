    The season was filled with grey clouds, a hint of cold air with a dash of darkness.
    I have this urge to find some red tea and a chicken sandwich, this itch must be resolved.

## Notes

Cooking stream? When and Where?

## 2025

### Tailwindcss v4

-   02:00AM

    Finally made the switch to v4, but that means that we will have to make the switch to react v19 soon too.
    I am glad that I took a break from the mobile development because that would have driven me insane to work on v18 to v19 for react native.
    Both sites build but there is still some breaking changes, like backdrop blur and ring issues, but they can all be resolved with some quick replacing.

### Python Nx

-   02:30AM

    Before even touching the python environment, it would make sense to update the @nxlv/python plugin!
    For this, we are just doing a minor version bump, should not affect anything.
    Next, I will test that out with updating the library of components.

-   05:03AM

    Agno seems like a great library to test out!
    The bigger question would be in figuring out what standard model and embeddings we should use, because then it would make things easier to build across multiple people.
    Looking at the gwen series and that might be the best choice for now, going to add that into the flow.

### Wheel of Time S3

-   10:25PM

    Season three has been compact but filled with side stories, something that I love!
    The world building is amazing and the characters are so well developed, that its great research material for the RareIcon.


### RareIcon Dual.

-   10:05PM

    The website will have the game but we can use it as our CDN as well!
    I am thinking that it would make sense to build our first CDN, that layers ontop of existing ones like Cloudflare, part of this would be to make lottie files easier to access.
    When grabbing the SVGs and lotties, we know that they are a certain size but having it all stored within the idb layer and cache layer would be great for performance.
    Object A loads from the CDN, which includes the cloudflare layer, and then inserts it into the idb client-side.
    Actually, it be really interesting if we could IPFS the files too, moving the load out of a central server and since these files will be small, it should be a great start towards building our first CDN.
    The SEO and marketing benefits of having RareIcon be an icon CDN will be great for the game too.


## 2024

### Logging

For the Atlas program, we will use the built in logging system that comes with `uvicorn`!
To do this, we just import the logging and grab the `uvicorn` logger, like this below:

```python

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("uvicorn")

```

Then we have three functions that we can use:

```python

    logger.info("[info]")
    logger.warning("[warn]")
    logger.error("[err]")

```

In the future we would want to integrate a way to move specific warnings out of the logger and into a metric system.


### Atlas Template

We have two options for the template system, i.e. loading static files from `template`.
However, I suggest we opt for simplicity on the backend by returning a generic HTML template and dynamically loading the JavaScript.


### KBVE Front Page

Going to take a quick break from the python realm and see if I can mess around with the front page and its code for a bit.
I noticed that the wavey carousel seems to break the viewpoint and cause the x to over extend on the mobile phone, creating this weird white space bug!
Oh the joys of CSS and responsive design, another adventure down the meme design mindduck, let me get started.

To get the dev kbve website up and running on port 4321, the default astro port, we run this command:

`./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:dev`.

I am thinking the fix for this would be to wrap the VE widget, like below:

```js

	<div class="">
		<VE widget="carousel:highflyer:wave" slider={waveslider} />
	</div>

```

Then inside of the `class` , we slap around some basic tailwindcss to help us account for the various situations, including the overflows.

Actually I am thinking we could just scratch both of those components, the wave and the scroll effect and maybe start with a fresh full screen landing page.

Now the question is what would we make this page about?
Here is what I am thinking as the base so far:

```html

	<div class="w-full h-screen">
		<div>Hi</div>
	</div>

```

We start with a `w-full` and `h-screen` to at least make sure the landing page takes the whole screen.
