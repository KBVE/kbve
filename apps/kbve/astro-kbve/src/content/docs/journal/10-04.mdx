### Unity 6 CVE

-   01:38PM

    Resolved the Unity 6 CVE issue and upgraded to the latest LTS version.
    This time the upgrade did not have any major issues but also I think our ECS framerate also jumped.
    Now we are reaching around 200FPS, but that might be also because we lowered the amount of entities on the map.
    I will have to loop back around and see if there are any other issues that we might need to resolve.

## 2024

**Dashboard**

The goal for the day is to update the dashboard by integrating it directly with the Supabase!
One the load of the dashboard, we will focus on presenting a drag-able container system, where the user can control the different services that they have active within their account.
In the future, if we launch different AI tools and bots, we want to make it easy for the user to enable and disable them.

**Events**

For the redirects, I am thinking we could setup the redirects directly around the eventEmitter concept?
The type of event that we would create would be the `redirect` but I am not too sure how we would handle the `off` for it once they leave the page.
In a `spa` this would be easy because it would be just moving the code to mimic the redirect but in our case, we actually have to have the javascript exit.

**Profile**

Starting with the profile updates to the Supabase, we want to make sure that the user can update their profile's bio and their avatar URL.
However this might be a bit of a concern in the long term because we have no way to verify the location of the profile image, if its a valid png or jpeg, ect...
I am thinking that there might be a couple solutions to the this problem, we could use the aws storage to keep track of their profile image?
The other option would be to github or image proxy the avatar before loading it on the website.
We could also just disable avatars?

As for the Bio, I am thinking that keeping the limit to 225 characters and make the regex limit the type of characters that can be passed through.
