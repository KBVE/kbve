### Journal Mismatch

-   04:15AM

    I been missing some of the journal entries for this whole past month.
    New KBVE website is going to be amazing.

### Unity DOTS Prefabs

-   07:46AM

    Just finished migrating the gameobjects towards a pure ECS/DOTS build.
    However the damn materials are such a pain.

-   06:44PM

    Time to try the prefab generation again, hopefully this time it works without causing problems.

### Robot Unicorn Attack

-   08:14AM

    I am thinking of making a quick game.
    Why? Because it be interesting to see what we can do to keep my mind flowing.

    **Kanban**

    After knocking out for almost a whole day, it was time to head back into the grind.
    The realtime was actually a bit easier than I thought, but lets just make sure everything works at the production level.
    I take it back, there might have to be another way for us to use the kanban, hmm, I am thinking that we could just shift away from the supabase and use amazon key store from AWS?
    We can just skip all of the supabase and just build our own simple storage for key value and call it from there.
    The amount of time this is taking is way too long, I am sure a simple amazon key store would be better suited for this.

    **keyDB**

    Okay I am going to backtrack the usage of the supabase and try to use a straight keydb storage as a replacement.
    The base of the application will be under the `rust_kanban` and it will handle the data transfer between the kanban client and the amazon db.
    Considering that the amazon db offers over 200m queries each month, there should not be major issue with this deployment.
    I was considering the fact that we can also cache the kanban through the api too, to save on the calls.
    Okay! after 12 hours, we were able to convert almost everything over to rust!
    Granted I did spend a good chunk of that time doing other things, but now going to make a new note.

    **Helm**

    Now to build out the pipeline for the docker build and deploying it all using helm charts.
    Before building out the helm chart, I need to switch back around and make sure that the docker build is good to go.
    This way the hlem chart will deploy that docker image and we can have it sit under the ingress of `kanban.kbve.com`.
