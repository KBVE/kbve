### Laptop Replacement

-   08:16PM

    Might be time to replace my older laptop because the WSL instance is just hanging way too much.
    Yeah I am going to start shopping around, waiting for over 80 seconds to confirm that a file has been saved is way too much.
  
### IronJedi on TurtleWoW

-   11:00PM

    The plan is add a bunch of easy macros to use and get the shaman all the way up to 60!
    I might also look back around and try to make a lvl 19 twink, as part of the research.
    Furthermore, I should loop back around and see why the AzerothCore seems to fail at starting up.

**Roma**
I will update this entry when I get back to the cafe.


**Expo**
Let us go ahead and setup the hqplan deployment.
The plan here would be to run a couple series of developments.

## 2023
- 3:10pm - I need to wrap up building this `backup` plan for work, I am going to extend it out to around 50 pages and then add a ton of graphs and visual aids! I know that it will have way too much information and no one will really read it but that will be on me to tell them over and over. I want them to memorize it once its completed! Then in a couple years, I will release it under this repo.
- 5:04pm - Daily chores are out of the way, now I am going to fix up the Docker. 
- 8:56pm - Added loadash to the docker image, I should push that out for now and fix up some of the notes that I would reference.
