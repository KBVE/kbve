    **Kanban**

    The plan is to make a simple guest kanban for people to practice or quickly use one for whatever task they want.
    To keep the size low, I will have it expire after a year aka 365 days and then we will keep it to around 3 panels , with a set inventory of objects to be added.

    **Round2**

    Lets get that realtime going for kanban and maybe we can get live mouse movements too.
    That would mean we would have to setup a multi mouse realtime, hmm, react side that would be keeping track of the mouse state.

    **Elemental**

    The operator is up and running, now we need to focus on building the first container image.
    There are a couple things that I need to figure out, like the `Registgration Endpoint` crate and a couple other things.
    The new folder for the configurations will be in the `_os` folder under `/migrations/kube/_os`.
