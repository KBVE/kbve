### Unity Pathfinding in ECS

-   11:35AM

    I did not expect to have the pathfinding to be such a pain point!
    Besides the collisions, just getting the movement down with 100,000 units is the hardest thing that I have dealt with.
    We are getting closer towards something that is balanced around 60FPS, maybe I will drop the units back down to less than a couple hundred and move on.

-   03:45PM

    Wrapping up the daily pathfinding and making sure that everything works as intended.
    Sadly that was all a pipedream because the pathfinding is still very much broken.

**Cluster**

```

kubectl get pods -n supabase
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
supabase-release-supabase-auth-5b7fdcd9b7-9qlgk        1/1     Running   0          10h
supabase-release-supabase-db-1                         1/1     Running   0          9h
supabase-release-supabase-db-2                         1/1     Running   0          9h

supabase-release-supabase-rest-7ccb7f5954-z9862        1/1     Running   0          11h
supabase-release-supabase-storage-857d655cd7-zr96b     1/1     Running   0          10h
supabase-release-supabase-studio-b6bdf46-lqk8h         1/1     Running   0          11h

```

We finally got a state that is stable and running!
This took us a while to get going but it was under a month, so for our first round that is not bad at all.
Now to make sure that everything is working, we need to test the barman and the backup and recovery process.
Furthermore, we will need to plan for scaling out the cluster, past the base of 1/1 units.

Note: `supabase-release-supabase-db-1` is our `readwrite` and `supabase-release-supabase-db-2` is our `readonly` instance.


**Kilobase**

The bug with the `String` that is causing a segfault might have a couple solutions, the first was upgrading pgrx back to `v0.12.4` but that is not an option for us because the clang version for postgres v15 is `10` and the latest pgrx recommends clang 11 or higher.
The other possible error could come from us installing `15.8` rather than `15.1`.

**Barman**

The best move here would be to start the `postgres.mdx` and update it with more information related to `Supabase`, `Barman`, `Cloudnative-PG` and more!
Ended up staying up all night but I was able to get the barman running and it turned out to be a lot easier than what I was doing earlier.
Furthermore, there is a go plugin coming out soon, so it might become even easier in the future!

**Redis**

While I am updating the `postgres.mdx`, I should wrap back around and update our `redis.mdx` too because it would make things easier for us in the long term.
The will be to link the redis from armada into the supabase, then switch the background worker to communicate with that redis instance!


**Applications**

I need to get back into the habit of keeping better notes and information through our `/application` docs!
There has been a lack of new updates and content for that section this whole year, but I will try to get better at updating it all and getting back into the flow.

## 2023
- 5:53am - Freaky Friday! Today this going to be a heavy hitter type of day, I want to bang out a ton of my backlogs and maybe try to create about 50-60 more issue tickets, bringing my total far past the 100 mark. 
- 6:37am - The first object that I want to place into the YoRHa UI will be the `Drill` item object, located [here](https://i.imgur.com/ddKIcQu.png) and it will serve as the `tool` to repair the ship, robots and will have an energy requirement. I am not too sure how I will go about handling it all, but I am thinking of just placing the object onto the map and then seeing where I can go from there. The other task would be making sure that the player can register and login? All three of these missions will help me towards the backend migration. I am thinking of creating just one function for the game and then assigning paths for the different actions? It would be a bit rough to just make a function for EACH event, as that might be a bit too much isolation and a bit reparative. So placing the tool , then shifting towards a bit of the backend for the game, that will be the main focus for the day! We also have the autoGPT to look into, but that should be later on the day.
- 4:40pm - There are a couple interesting things going on with the AutoGPT hackathon but I shall see how I feel about it later through out the day.
- 1:01am - It seems that the best course of action will be to delete the existing AutoGPT repo and then make a new one for the event. The older one that I had some issues and was flooding my grafana with useless logs, skyrocketing the size of my logs from a couple hundred megabytes to almost several gigs. The errors were just a bit too much for my cup of tea.
