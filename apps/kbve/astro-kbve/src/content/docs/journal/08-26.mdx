## 2024

**Roma**
The city of rome is way too crazy, I can not keep track of time or myself haha.
I forgot to update the daily journal, so let me throw some entries around.

**Postgres**
We will have to prepare for the postgres migration and setup.

**k8s**
We will have to prepare for the kubes.
The migration will require someone to help with the flow.
We have a couple different kubes to run and mess around with, hopefully we wont run into issues.
