## Notes

## 2025

### Nx Workspace v20.5.0

-   12:39AM

    Upgrading the Nx Workspace to the latest version, might resolve some issues with expo.
    For this, I will have to go through the `nx migrate` command and see what it does.

### Github Actions Utils Docker Publish

-   01:23AM

    There was an issue with the `utils-publish-docker-image.yml` action that I had created recently.
    It seems that one of the variables is causing a trigger error, so let me resolve that now.

    The full issue was this:

    ```
    secret name `GITHUB_TOKEN` within `workflow_call` can not be used since it would collide with system reserved name
    ```

    First attempt to resolve it would be to just rename it to another variable name.

-   04:45PM

    Based upon the updated workflow name, it seems that we were able to patch that security issue regarding the secret name.

### Gunsin

-   04:06PM

    The adventures of Gunsin, with Kin and Fudster, oh boi, these is going to be fun!
    I am hoping we do not get picked off by that level 25 elite. 
    Hmm, I will need a new axe for him, it seems that I might have solid it off xD?

### Kilobase Debug

-   10:37PM

    The debug command would make it easier to test it locally before pushing it up to the kubernetes.
    Okay, next I am going to pass in the env but before I do that, hmm there might be an issue with the storage, let me double check it.

-   11:29PM

    The next issue that we need to resolve is the `PGSodium` issue that has been open for a while, I been waiting for Supabase to replace it but has not yet happen.
    

## 2024

### Output

The biggest issue that I am seeing with this current game is the massive `fish-chip.js` file.
I am going to read through the `output-manualchunks` from the RollUpJS Guide and see what I can do around improving the [build](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks).


### PlanetScale

It might be time to just drop the support of PlanetScale and switch back to the Postgres / Supabase setup.
The main reason we want to do this is to handle the websocket and player movement.

### Supabase Test Reports

This is the repo for their [test reporting system](https://github.com/supabase/test-reports) and I am going to keep track of it, probably to keep watch of the changes and how they handle their reports.
My plan would be to then to migrate some of their concepts into the Outpost for KBVE.
I still been working on the Outpost generation but there is a ton that is missing that I need to improve upon! Ugh, there is almost no time.


### Supabase

For the storage of the KBVE types and general handling of it, I will just create a new library to help with it!
Generic command for starting a new library -> `npx nx g @nx/js:lib mylib --bundler=vite`.

We will create the `supabase` ts file within the `postgres` library.
