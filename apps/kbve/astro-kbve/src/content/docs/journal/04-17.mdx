## 2025

### Svelte v5

-   09:00AM

    Spent most of the morning trying to debug these god damn svelte issues with vite 6 and inside of astro but made some decent progress.

### Lottie

-   06:30PM

    Finish the day off a bit early, got a quick trip to Edison and we got the carousel to finally render without any major issues!
    The entries for the day are short, most of my notes are scattered around in my journal, will have to loop back and adjust them.

## 2024

**Milestone**

This is will be the official one year mark for our journal system!
Now I have to migrate the older entries into this vault, which might be a bit painful because I definitely missed some earlier entries.

I do need to find a way to atuoamtically pull in my tasks , but that will be a future holy problem.

**Python**

Let us open up the python stack and see what we can do!
First we want to make sure that the Dokcer build works as intended.

```shell

cd ~/github/kbve/apps/atlas
docker build -t exampleapp .

```

However I am thinking we could split the docker image and build process a bit more?
Maybe we make a `v01d` docker image and then use that as the base for what we want, hmm.

## 2023

**Astro**

-   I am running into weird issues with Astro 2.3.0, going to delay the upgrade until I can resolve them.

-   Started to make a Windows 11 template for the RSPS Project, but damn it seems to be a pain to get it all optimized and secure.

-   Should we keep raw daily notes? Or would it be too much information? Hmmm.

-   While I am in India, I just finished setting up my NR accounts, it feels interesting being a dual citizen. The idea that I can be on the other side of the world and live a completely different life style.

-   It was a bumper to see Starship flight get scrubbed.

-   Damn really had to put quotes on the title to avoid the YAML error.

The error is here:

```ini
7:18:30 PM: [astro:content-imports] can not read a block mapping entry; a multiline key may not be an implicit key
7:18:30 PM: file: /opt/build/repo/src/content/_bin/_daily.md?astroContent=true:4:4

I had to wrap the title inside quotes to help with the mapping. >.>
