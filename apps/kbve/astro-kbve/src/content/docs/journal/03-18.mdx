## Notes

## 2025

### Github Crate Matrix

-   01:20PM

    Damn matrix seems to fail when building a json query, the issue seems that if all the crates are false for publishing, it produces an invalid json object.
    However, the first solution would be to include a simple patch to include a placeholder object, thus I will try that first.

### KBVE Fork v1

-   01:53PM

    Forking the whole monorepo and working on it under `h0lybyte` is the goal for this Q2.
    If everything goes as planned, then we can look at the azure and gitlab pipelines afterwards, ideally making it so the monorepo can stay replicated in multiple locations.
    The repo structure will be like this:
    
    1.  Github for Public.
    2.  Gitlab for Private Teams + Outside Developers - focus on backend applications.
    3.  Azure for Private Internal + Code for non-monorepo behaviors, like Unity.

    Provides us with the flexibility of an open source nature with the perks of private source integrations.

## 2024


### Multiplayer

I decided to take a short break from the pathing issue and look at how I would want to implement a multiplayer.
We know that the discord embed sdk comes out today!

### Colyseus

I am going to start the test casing for the Colyseus example and get a general test case out there for production.

The start of these notes will be within this [repo](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/tree/main/examples/react-colyseus) for start of the project.

So the outline of the App stack would be like this:

- React
- Phaser
- Colyseus

Plugins: 

- Enabled3D , this being optional.
- Grid Engine, this being optional.

### Embed

The Discord Embed App Pitch 2024 starts within a month, but they are doing a small `buildathon` this week!
I am thinking that it would make sense to first go through the `buildathon` and make a moch application, this will help us debug any issues that might come up during the pitch.

I am going to write out the notes and think about how I should prepare and deploy the `Wumpus Wumbo party` an the first test case for the jam and using that as the test case. This includes loading any and all of the "abstractions".
During this process, I noted that the pathing is not working as expected, but it seems that Discord uses a reverse proxy for the pathing of the assets.
