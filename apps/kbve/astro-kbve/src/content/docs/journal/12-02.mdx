    **JavaScript FFI**

    Even though we got the websockets wired, we still have a decent amount of work to do!
    There is a decent amount of javascript / discord sdk integration that we still have to finish.
    Ugh, part of me just does not feel like doing it but logically, I need to get it all done asap.
    Sunday was not a funday.
    Okay, so the first error we need to address is making sure that everything using the interop is placed inside of if statements.

    **Bounty**

    Taking a quick break from the unity sessions and working on the bounty system.
    I am going to map it out using no code first and then once its functional, I will try to make it in rust.
    The idea would be to automatically manage the bounties, including the verfication, payments, ect...
    The bounty system should create a new invoice and keep track of the sessions?
    Maybe a calendar style integration would make sense too.
    Under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` we will create the `bounty.md` file.
    Copy over some of the information into that file next.
    Okay, we got the base of the bounty system out of the way!

    **Autopull**

    A new issue ticket to keep track of some chores that need to be done via the Github actions.
    I believe we need to lock down some of the repos and build a quick system that would handle the pull requests.
    We should make it so that the pull requests are also not only created but maybe work towards having the pull request accepted too.

    **UnityJS**

    The unity js library will help us bridge the unity webgl and the javascript from the browser.
    We want to make sure that the communication will work on Itch, but that will be in 2025.
    After creating the library using the nx library generation, we need to add a couple more references and deps.
    The discord embed sdk and the cross fetch both will be helpful here.
