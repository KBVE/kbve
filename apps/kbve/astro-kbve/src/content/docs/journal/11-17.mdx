    **Tickets**

    We need to make new adjustments to our issue tickets, I believe placing them under an `unity` tag would make sense.
    This is just a quick shower thought that I had but I will try to add a bit of a better system tonight regarding that.

    **TileMap**

    Besides building out the unity game via github actions, I want to see if I can make a script that will streamline the tilemap creation.
    Ideally we would want the tilemap script to make a `world` map, one where you are moving from section A to section B, and as you move through this path, lets say East to West?
    The map would automatically generate the tiles and things that would be in your way through your quest, including mobs, traps, npcs and more?
    This might feel like its going to be a huge part of the gameplay loop, because it will generate additional side content for the player to try out.

    **JSON**

    Looks like the json package was missing from the build process, I am not too sure why it got removed or if I forgot to install it in the first place?
    Anyhow, going to add that into the build setup and see if we can move forward with the build process.
    I can already tell there might be a bunch of other issues during the linking process of unity and the final build, but having the bug reports directly there in the logs does make things easier.
    For the ally management, I am thinking we add a couple additional characters for our bullet hell type game, the first was Gala, she will be our space pirate type character.
    We should pull references from cowboy bebop and one piece, maybe a bit of that iron fleet too into her story line.

    **WebView**

    Okay it seems that during the WebGL build, it is pulling in the Vuplex configuration, which we do not want.
    i.e
    ```c#

    #if UNITY_WEBGL && !UNITY_EDITOR
        WebGLWebView.FocusUnity();
    #endif
    ```

    So we need to go back around in our code and make those adjustments.
    Actually, instead of wasting my time trying to figre it out, I will just embrace it and pickup the iframe version.
    Might as well set aside a couple hundred dollars for the iOS and Android later tonight too, we will just have to commit.

    **WebGL**

    Looks like the WebGL build was done without any major issues, so lets go ahead and link the build to Itch!
    We can have it pull the webgl after its finished from the job and use that finished file for our beloved itch.
    Yay! The game builds and we got a live version on the itch, now lets see if the pipeline will update the builds.
    Going to make a new push right now and see where it goes from there.
