## Notes

## 2025

### NanoWorkers

-   04:08AM

    If I can find a way to get all the workers, shared, web and service to work idb and nanostores under just a single usable library.
    I tried to do this earlier when I was in Italy but not no major luck, so maybe I can loop back around and try it again.

### OffCanvas Svelte

-   08:05AM

    The goal would be to build the svelte component to handle 10,000+ entities but without having a huge performance hit.
    Since the human eye can only handle so many views, we could use a `virtual scroller` to only show the items that are in view.
    The plan would work like this, ughhh, the sharedworker pre-renders and stores HTML cards, using a seeding or sync data method where the entities are built in the background as an off canvas.
    We then pull only a batch of visible cards into a pool and then swap the cards out as the user is scrolling horizontally, creating an infinite scroll effect or illusion?.
    Finally we can use the `{@html html}` to inject the HTML into the view, hmm, that might defeat the purpose of using Svelte.
    This becomes an interesting situation where we want to build around svelte's static nature of optimization but still have this dynamic virtual inner DOM.
    I suppose the argument here could be made that we are trying to use the wrong tool in the belt, but that is part of the learning process.    

## 2024

### Charles

We are back online with Charles!
Yay! This has been a long time coming, almost since end of October that we would have an operational and self-hosted ML project.
A ton of effort has went into getting here, I can not wait to see where we go from this point.

The plan for charles right now is to setup the promox instance with the functional GPU passthroughs, ideally extending out the vGPUs.

### Python

Updating the monorepo's python install to make sure it is `3.12` for now, I will try and prepare another update for `3.13` once all the other libraries are updated and ready.



### k8s

The next move would be to prepare the `k8s` migration for our docker and docker swarm.
We will most likely use a `kre2` as our base kube framework, its a nice blend of upstream k8s and k3s but with security in mind.
