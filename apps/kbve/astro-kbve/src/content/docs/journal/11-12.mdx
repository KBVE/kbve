    **Early**

    Nothing feels so great like a great new day!
    Today is going to be a big day, I am going to go ham with the publishing and see if I can resolve a bunch of abstract bugs.
    Ugh, I went to check if I had react hook form and the resolves installed and I completely forgot that I did!
    We really need to make sure our package json is cleaned up and ready for these future updates.

    Let me start by making more issue tickets with things that I need to resolve.
    The joys of waking up early and running the greatest command.

    ```shell

    ./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:start
    
    ```

    **EXPO**

    The next plan is to adjust the error situation because it seems that the error is not passing up.
    Which means that we have two additional options, one being using an event system and the other using a worklet, hmm, maybe a combo of both?
    Lets go ahead and tackle this right now before I forgot.

    There are six areas that we need to test out, the first is improving the memo utilization and memory usage.
    React should be able to handle the memory management, but we should look at maybe adding our own ways to make this easier, hmm.
    The second part was the `React.lazy` and having it help us offset some of the loading of the more complex animations and components, I suppose that can be used with our offscreen objects.
    The third part would be the `React Context API` but that might be too much of an issue for us to utilize right now, but it does make sense to have it pass some objects.
    The fourth part will be having the useTransitions to help smooth out the hicups and then there are the other additional libraries, ugh!
    I need to becareful not to bloat up the application as well, maybe we can keep these noted and tackle the optimization later on.
    
    So the goal would be to build these components out:

    -   `useIdleCallback`
    -   `useCache`
    -   `useMemory`
    -   `useLazyMemory`
    -   `useOffScreen`
    -   `useVirtual`

    All of them can then be placed into the `core` of our expo package, making it so that we can use them in the future to help us handle some of the future issues that will require optimization.
