    **Dec**

    The last month of the year, that means I need to also make sure all the credit card payments are cleared.
    Yet I do also have to double check my car insurance, the year is slowly coming to and end!
    Steam release? When?

    **Discord**

    Might as well start working on the discord bot integration while doing the websockets.
    Yet for some reason the passage of the token is throwing some random errors.
    Okay the new token was added and some adjustments were made for the sealed secret too.
    Hmm, I wonder what would be the best way to communicate directly with the unity client from the javascript.

    **Core**

    The discord embed sdk should make sure that the user that is in the activity has a valid session.
    We will focus on the `NetworkManager`, making sure that it loads the right configurations.
    Furthermore, we should make sure that the `index.html` has no issues either, hmm.

    **NetworkManager**

    For the networking, we have to account for three possible connection points, two being different websockets and the other being the UDP.
    With that being said, having the cross-play will be easier once we get the different connections setup and doing this all in advance will save us time in the future.
    The whole networking will be packaged, so that when we build new games in the future, we will not have to go back and do it again.

    However with that being said, we do need to focus on how we would point the network around and that would include the ability of adding new networks without having issues.
    This does limit the package to being only used with kbve-related services but we can work around that by fixing up adding a couple abstraction methods?
    Like if it does not use the default, we could add the ability to add external networks, maybe a map to hold those and a quick setting that can be changed in the map.

    **JavascriptFFI**

    The FFI for JavaScript should be placed under the `Networks` and I believe we might need to move the `NetworkManagerHelper` to be under the `Networks` namespace?
    The first aspect makes sense because the javascript ffi would all be done within the reference of networking.
    Yet the helper might make sense to keep next to the network manager, as it would be rough to keep them too far away.
    For the javascript ffi, since most of it all will be in webgl, I am thinking we could just avoid the interlocked methods.
    And for the rust ffi, we will use the interlocked because those builds are for native, I am just keeping this here as a reference.
