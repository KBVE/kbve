    On April 1st, the world becomes my playground, a day when chaos and laughter intertwine, and everyone gets a taste of shaco's delight. 
    It's a glorious moment where pranks bloom like flowers in spring, a reminder to dance on the edge of madness and never, ever play it safe.

## Notes

## 2025

### Unity CICD

-   04:40AM

    Made more changes to the base pipeline at the azure level and once the custom map is rolled out, we can start the UIUX.
    The gameplay will be to add the custom characters, then add the first custom map + item collections.
    Once all of that is integrated, we can do the first level roll out on Steam.

### JokeCity

-   09:34AM

    I have to remind myself that nothing is real today and the memes are alawys in full force.
    But that should not be a big deal, I will just stay away from the news xD.


### Twitch IRC

-   07:40PM

    Making sure that the twitch irc works, we will have to look into how the `refreshing-token` feature is being used in the crate.

## 2024

### Docker

Getting the `express-colyseus-discord` build operation on the portainer will be the goal for today!
This includes having an endpoint for the portainer communication, which would include the deployment of any changes via github actions.
We need to keep track of the X, Y, Z and maybe a couple other variables in a 3D space?

The next variable that I will be adding is the `action`, which is a string for now!
This is just extending the `TPlayerOptions` with `action` and then defining the action as a type string.



### LCAgents

We want to move the changes for LC Agents outside of the `ci-alpha` and towards the `ci-main`, so that we can keep the changes in order!
After moving it towards the main branch, we can extend out the iOS and Android build process for Expo, now we need to make sure that the current flow will work.
We might also want to automate the pull requests that it makes on the LC Agents repo as well, hmm.

Here is the pipeline that we are migrating with this push:

```yaml

        expo-lcagents-web-build:
            needs: ['alter']
            name: Expo LC Agents We Build
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            if: needs.alter.outputs.expolcagents == 'true'
            steps:
                -   name: Checkout repository

```


### Pipeline

Under the `beta` branch, we can extend out integration testing, something that I can plan around this month. 
We will start with the `kbve.com` repo , which will just build the site, making sure that it runs?
The other idea would be to deploy the `beta` of the website to `beta.kbve.com`, as an additional metric, but that might be something we can look into within the future.

We will be using the `any_changed` to calculate any of the files that are changed.



### LC Agents

Here is the older code block for the LC Agents Expo application.

```js

import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';

import { ExpoRoot } from 'expo-router';
import 'expo-router/entry';
import BaseApp from './src/app/_layout';



// The ExpoRoot component requires a React element, not a component class or function directly.
// Therefore, we create a simple wrapper component that returns BaseApp.
function AppWrapper() {
  return <BaseApp />;
}

// Pass the wrapper component to ExpoRoot.
// ExpoRoot will take care of rendering your application within the Expo environment,
// ensuring that routing and other setup is handled correctly.
//registerRootComponent();

//ExpoRoot(<AppWrapper />);

// 03-27-2024 Changes


export function App() {
   const ctx = require.context('./src/app');
   return <ExpoRoot context={ctx} />;
}

registerRootComponent(App);


// Create a new component that renders ExpoRoot with AppWrapper.
// This component will be the entry point of your application.
// function RootComponent() {
//   return ExpoRoot(<AppWrapper />);
// }

// registerRootComponent(RootComponent);
```

However there are a couple errors that are appearing in the source code, including this one: 

`You are calling ReactDOMClient.createRoot() on a container that has already been passed to createRoot() before. Instead, call root.render() on the existing root instead if you want to update it.`

So there might be an issue with how we are doing the root / application rendering.
