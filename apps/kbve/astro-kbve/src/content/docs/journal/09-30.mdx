### ECS Pathfinding

-   09:17AM

    Made some progress with the pathfinding but still have to convert it from a SystemBase to an ISystem.
    Furthermore there are a ton of float3s in the code, I will have to clean all of that up too.
    Finally, we need to make sure that the new state management system does not become a pain point, as we need to remove a decent amount of the booleans.

## 2024

**Redis**

The next plan for the Redis instance under the `armada` is to bridge the service between the itself and the `supabase`!
From my understanding it will be just two yaml configurations, one for the network policy and another for the external service.

So the two kinds that we will be making are `Service` and `NetworkPolicy`, I will be placing both of those into the a single file called `redis-armada-bridge.yaml`.
We want to utilize our redis master instance for the postgres instance first and then later on it will be extended out to the rust for processing and finally the n8n for additional abstract support.
The n8n integration will give us the no-code style of flow for building out and mapping theories.


**Recovery**

Nothing is more fun than setting up recovery and the joys and huge pain points that come with it!
The recovery will be be from the same `GitRepo` / `GitOps`, starting with: 

Repo: `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git`
Paths: `/migrations/kube/charts/kilobase`

We got all three instances running, so it looks like the issue with recovering a postgres is to double check the base and WALs before doing a recovery.

```

supabase-release-supabase-db-1                         1/1     Running   0          3m25s
supabase-release-supabase-db-2                         1/1     Running   0          2m14s
supabase-release-supabase-db-3                         1/1     Running   0          78s

```

**Kilobase**

The tokio runtime seems to create a segfault in the cluster and thus, I am thinking that we would keep the function of the background worker to maybe store the URL into a redis cluster.
We can then throw together an isolated container that would read from the redis, process the URL and then store back the data via a transaction.

From my understanding, at this point, this function causing the segfault in the postgres when enabling the extension:

```rust

fn process_url(url: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
  let rt = Runtime::new().unwrap();
  rt.block_on(process_url_async(url))
}

```

Thus the best solution would be to move that all out into its own isolated container, which I will build using axum.
We can even migrate the older function into this isolated application.

```rust


fn process_url(url: &str) -> Result<String, String> {
  let client = Client::new();

  // Make a blocking HTTP GET request
  let response = client
    .get(url)
    .send()
    .map_err(|e| format!("HTTP request failed: {}", e))?;

  if response.status().is_success() {
    let body = response.text().map_err(|e| format!("Failed to read response body: {}", e))?;
    Ok(body)
  } else {
    Err(format!("HTTP request returned non-200 status: {}", response.status()))
  }
}

```

**LongHorn**

During our disaster recovery, I noticed that while everything else came back online, the PVC management still needs to be adjusted.
For this situation, we would need to setup a replica of the storage on another S3-type bucket and make the automatic sync a bit easier.
Upon init container, we should hold off the storage deployment until the postgres database is operational, a possible point that we can adjust across all of the supabase concepts.
