    **Unity**

    Another great unity session, I am starting to understand the way tilemaps work within unity!
    There are a couple minor things that we still need to adjust for, yet, the overall flow is turning out to be so much better.
    As for the recent updates, I am going to push them up and maybe we can aim to have a playable game that has no mm assets by this weekend?
    If everything goes as planned, we can hit a steam launch before the end of the year, which would feel amazing.
