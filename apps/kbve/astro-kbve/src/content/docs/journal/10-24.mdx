### Rust Combat States - AFK

-   11:00PM

    The night was spent just going through the state management, I believe we will just use a dashmap for this!
    Part of the flaw in our logic is that under the web builds, we will have a tough time managing a fake thread and furthermore moving logic.
    I realized that I should have kept the logic to a rust signal system instead, oh well, next time I will know better.

## 2024

**RSPS**

We should split out the RSPS from the Atlas docker setup and keep them both isolated.
It would make more sense to manage them as different entities.
While building out the expo updates, I started to work on a rsps docker image that still needs to be pushed out and built.
The idea was to remove the chrome and python code from atlas and swap out the client with another jar, making it more focused on running the java virtual machine.
For mouse movement and general automation, we might just use rust and maybe emulate the mouse and keyboard driver.

**Mount**

The minifed error looks like this:

```
Error: Minified React error #301; 
visit https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=301 
for the full message or use the non-minified dev environment for full errors and additional helpful warnings.
```

The actual error is this:

```
 Uncaught Error: 
 Attempted to navigate before mounting the Root Layout component. 
 Ensure the Root Layout component is rendering a Slot, or other navigator on the first render.
```

So we will wrap back around to the router and maybe setup a loading screen type component, hmm, like a universal skeleton?
This means we can wrap backaround and replace the `useRouter` from the expo-router with our custom router, `useBBQ`.
Next we can customize the BBQ router, at least in the future, to have a skeleton / loading screen to help make the transitions from one scene to another very smooth.

Damn it seems that the issue still has not been resolved, maybe we could go back to the board and start removing the redirects that we have on all the applications.
Manually moving from one scene to another would be the only way we can move forward at this point because I still do not understand why we having issues with the redirect.

Ugh okay, I am just going to remove the redirecting because its too much of a pain and we will just present the user with some buttons that will give them the option to go to where they want to go.

**BBQ**

Updated the BBQ component with the base skeleton and added a couple other mount checks.
Replacing the router any with the specific expo router should help with some of the type errors that we were getting.
This should work but I am still on the fenece.

**MediaHook**

I am still having some weird issues with the media query but I will have to reference back to the notes and get a better understanding of them.
There are a couple more things that I want to focus on but we can get there through test casing.

**Captcha**

Maybe the reason we are having that minified bug and react 301 error from the way we are handling the state of the captcha.
The plan is to track back and see if there are any issues with how we are handling the state management within this component.
