## 2024

**Market**
The market was brutal this morning, but I see it as a quick sale!
I am going to load up my 2024 Roth today, quickly grabbing what I can for around $7K but I might also be above the income to contribute.
If I end up going too high for this year, then I will just sell out and readjust or pay the fees, it is what it is.

**Margin**
The margin on one of my accounts is starting to creep up a bit and after a couple CDs clear up within the next couple months, I should plan to wipe that out.
That would mean that I am now really debt free within my personal name.
I was hoping to keep that margin afloat until the end of the year but there just isnt anything worth trading that makes enough to cover the interest on the capital.

**MemoryLeak**
When pulling back the data points, I noticed that the KBVE API was at around 35MB and not the 14MB that a fresh API would have.
I am trying to figure out the 20MB+ increase in the usage of the API running for over 2 months was from caching, maybe a static hash map increasing in size or the worse case, a memory leak.
While the memory leak would not be the end of the world, I believe it would be wise to look over the code and keep track of the changes.
The most recent parts that we added were Groq / mL / ai helper routes, but I do not think that they would cause that issue.
I am thinking that it is an Arc pointer issue or the way that I am handling the application state.
When I put my rusty hat back on, it will require a decent deep dive.

**Zod**
Here is the MapData as a Zod:

```ts

const PointSchema = z.object({
  x: z.number(),
  y: z.number(),
});

const INPCPositionSchema = PointSchema.extend({
  id: z.string().optional(),
});

const INPCObjectGPSSchema = z.object({
  ulid: z.string(),
  position: INPCPositionSchema,
});

const BoundsSchema = z.object({
  xMin: z.number(),
  xMax: z.number(),
  yMin: z.number(),
  yMax: z.number(),
});

const IMapDataSchema = z.object({
  bounds: BoundsSchema,
  tilemapKey: z.string(),
  tilesetName: z.string(),
  tilesetLayer: z.string(),
  tilesetImageUrl: z.string(),
  tilesetKey: z.string(),
  scale: z.number(),
  npcs: z.array(INPCObjectGPSSchema),
  jsonDataUrl: z.string(),
});


```

I am going add these zod configurations into the `types.ts` and I will then call it via the `mapdb` option.
Thus we will call the mapdb in the frontmatter like this : `mapdb: z.array(IMapDataSchema).optional(),`

**Login**
The new login page seems a bit okay but I think the modal was not too bad.
The register page makes sense for us to focus on but the login might feel like it is a step back?

**Register**
The next part of the `register` page update should include a link to the privacy and terms of service.
We want the future user to agree to all our legal terms, including the EULA and any additional future requests that we plan to place on the website.
I will come back around and look over it again tomorrow morning, I suppose a quick check box that links to all those documents for approval?
Hmm will we need to check if the checkbox is pressed on the backend as well?

## 2023
- 4:40pm - The first couple of Ubuntu GitLab actions had worked fine but a couple of the latter
- 6:45pm - All my chores are done and I believe it might be time for a couple quick league matches. I did some off the record journal entries because I wanted to take a bit of a break from the screen, so I will have to migrate them back to this md document. I feel like this is one of the only major drawbacks with doing a daily journal, it is trying to remember to take your physical notes and then convert them over to a digital format. I suppose the other side of it is realizing some of the notes are a bit stupid, but then again, even if they are a bit out of the norm, it might still make sense to document them. 
- 6:49pm - Should I go AP shaco or another round of tank shaco? Hmm, I also think the two new skins are okay, they could have done a bit more with the effects, I feel like the animation game was a bit weak but that might be just on my end. About to hit that 2 million mastery, which is a bit scary to think about. 
- 6:59pm - After I finish up the tag system, I should go back and refactor some of the media content, maybe that might give me a really good static API base to work with. One of the random ideas that I was thinking to add into the Discord music bot was to pull the json data for the YouTube content and basically play music from those tags? I could do a `musicbot` specific tag and extend it out? Hmm, I suppose how would I go about a duel tag search, so if object is on tag A and tag B? I guess this goes into the relationship style of tagging, such that, multiple entities could be linked via cross-tag. These are some questions that I have to think through as I build it out.
- 9:51pm - Seeing Futurama come back after being canceled over and over, I am surprised and somewhat glad the show is back... ugh again after being canceled? So far it is exactly the perfect balance of science and meme.  
- 10:36pm  - Going to sync the patch and preparing the next patch for tomorrow..
- 11:30pm - I should look into libraries that help the movement of the mouse, the two that I was looking at where pyHM and WindMouse, both could be combined into just one unique package? I suppose this would be something that we would operate under NodePy later down the line, in terms of automation as well.
