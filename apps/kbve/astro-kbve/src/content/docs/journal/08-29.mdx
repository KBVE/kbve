## 2024

**Train**

Leaving Rome once more, its been almost a decade since I was last here.
Next time I am going to come here with a bunch of helper notes.
A world wide scavengar hunt is also a cool idea for promoting Rent Earth.

**Postgres**

We could split the global key value storage but I think it might be fine to just use it within the postgres database.
Having it stored and saved at a core level within the postgres but then being pulled out and into redis would just save us time in the long term.

**Florence**
We are about to arrive in my favorite city in the world!
Well, Rome is not bad at all, I do believe it holds a great place in my heart, there is just something about Flora.
Maybe a trip to Siena next? 
Hmm, that is making me wonder if its worth the time investment to plan around a quick day trip.
Actually this would mean that working remotely and traveling around Italy for short bursts is possible without any major pain points.
Now I just need to find a girlfriend that can the same with me, ideally another software engineer and we would be set.


**Minions**

Going to focus on the minions folder for the worker script.
While I am working on that, I am also preparing the next batch of updates for the postgres and hqplan revamp.
Ugh there are a ton of moving parts that need to be cleaned up and updated but there is never enough time.
I am going to split the minions concept into a folder with about three to five files that will be the core of the whole system.
This is the current breakdown for these files within the Minions folder:

- minion.ts handles the creation and setup of Web Workers.

- minionWorker.ts is responsible for the worker's entry point and exposing the MinionImpl.

- minionImplementation.ts contains the actual business logic for the MinionImpl class.

The new `minion.ts` will look like this:

```ts

import * as Comlink from 'comlink';
import { MinionImpl } from './minionImplementation';

export function createMinion(id: string) {
  const workerUrl = new URL('./minionWorker.ts', import.meta.url);
  const minionWorker = new Worker(workerUrl, { type: 'module' });
  return Comlink.wrap<Comlink.Remote<MinionImpl>>(minionWorker);
}

```

**Food**

Took a break from programming and decided to venture around the city.
I am actually enjoying this vibe so much better than I was expecting, the amazing combination of being able to do all my work in the morning and then roam around the city.


**Church**

Did a loop around and looked at all the churchs again, and its a shame they stop making these masterpieces.
They really hold the community together and give the whole landscape a majestic vibe, in terms of lighting, shade and atompshere.
The churchs provides a metaphysical shelter for all, while you walk around it, a deep feeling of peace and safety.

## 2023

- 9:13am - Getting ready for the markets to open up, but before I do that, I should make sure everything is in sync. I will publish out this branch really quick before going a bit deeper into the deployments.

- 12:40pm - It seems that everyone at work was pleased with the backup plan and writeup that I did, I played deeper into the "Trump" style presentation, keeping to simple and short words that got the point across. I r regarded.

- 5:15pm - I am currently doing a bit of R&D on the different paths we could take for the file system management, which would also include the backup storage and the restoration. While my documentation can provide a decent roadmap for where we want to go, I think sometimes the time spent mapping out should not be overloaded because there will always be interesting and unique edge cases that will take a large chunk of time out of the implementation. This is just really a note to my future self on how to tackle those issues.
