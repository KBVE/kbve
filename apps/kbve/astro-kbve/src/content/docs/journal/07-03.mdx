## 2024

- 12:34am

I forgot to update the journal, so give me a bit of time to fix up the entries.

- 3:30pm

Time to go through and prepare the cryptothrone domain for a quick publish.
The idea should be a simple one page application / game, that will make it easy to work around with build.
For now we can launch a quick demo / pipeline and then slowly work through the kinks.

- 4:50pm

Tesla might cross over the $250 mark, this will be bad for us because then I might be forced to sell a bunch of shares.
I am thinking that it would be wise to just keep rolling the call options, even if its just for a couple hundred dollars a week.

- 6:25pm

CryptoThrone deployment, this was long over due and I think it might be a good summer hobby project.
We got adsense approval, so it might make sense to now start stream lining the process.

- 11:45pm

Before we end the night, I am thinking that it would make sense to build an engine to help handle some of the phaser situations that we will come across.

```shell

pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib laser --importPath="@kbve/laser" --publishable=true

```

This could be an engine that holds all our phaser code and also any additional utility code that we can use in future projects?

## 2023

- 10:00am 

Going to quickly head over to a friends house for a 4th of July party to help setup and prepare. 
I am about to do the classic h0ly move of bringing things, setting things up and then leaving early!

- 4:00pm

I have to split up the login form into two or three different classes or maybe have different modules?
I am a bit confused on the path that I want to take for setting up the login system.
This has been an issue for a bit way too long, I am thinking that I might just stick with very basic moves and then later on, go back to write it up.
