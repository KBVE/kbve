### Steam Integration

-   05:50AM

    Sent the review in for the coming soon page, which means we can start to collect wishlists by the end of this week.
    Next couple shifts will be focused on just the steam integrations and making sure everything loops together without any major breakage.

-   04:20PM

    The full library will be under the `MMExtensions` as SSDB, which we be a lifetime that holds all our steam code and will be built for just mac, linux and windows.
    As for the spacetime integrations, that part will be a bit rough from the start but I think we could adjust for it.
    The way that we resolve the core issues that might be with steam integration is going to be a bit tricky because I am not 100% sure how the internal system works for friends and cloud saves.

-   11:10PM

    Finished the basic layer of the steam integration, got the lifetime and vcontainer operation, which means that we can move forward with the abstraction + wrapper.
    There a couple things that I wanted to setup and build for the asset.

### NVDIA

-   03:30PM

    Sold 8 calls with the strike of $140 and another 8 are being prepared for $145.
    Going to roll this into finishing up the steam integration.

### R3 + ObservableCollections

-   11:00PM

    Finished reading up and studying both the R3 and Observable Collections , it makes more sense to include these into our game and utilize them.
    This can help speed things up before we add ECS and Burst, oh man I am excited to try these guys out!
    Cysharp is the only reason that I am willing to use unity at this point, they basically are the overlords of these amazing libraries and concepts.

**Meme**

Had to take a moment of break from programming, at least to get back into my flow because I am really running into some wild and annoying problems within my docker image.

**Adsense**

Yay! We are officially adsense approved and back on track of getting everything prepared for the Adsense Beta program.

This will be important for generating revenue for our free to play game, something that can cause issues down the line.
We also have a couple other side options, but the main one will be from Googles end because they have the best inventory to offer. 


**RimWorld**

Going to continue to take some breaks from python, its eatting away from my soul.

## 2023

- 6:00am - I was able to get the Conch setup with GPT, now I am looking to setup multiple different models for the user to pick and choose from. I had a bit of a late sleep, if you could even call it that but rather a small nap. I am tired but I am also glad that I got a bit more hands on experience with using Nanostores!
- 9:00am - Before the market opens, I shall take a bit of time to go through my edge instances and start to update the deployments. There are a couple instances that have not yet been updated since late last year, but they were all docker containers that did not have direct inbound connections, thus I was not too worried about them. Some of the major issues during this process was that there was no auto update and redeploying, even through I had watchtower looking over the instances. The auto-scaling seems to be no longer working but that might have to do with the fact that certain containers were degraded, thus I may have to double check my healthchecks.
- 11:00am - I am going to rewrite the cloud function of `6479653d74613fd2766e` and create a completely new one! I am going to stick with the default naming culture for now before creating a bit more of an unique structure. Within the timeline, I want to set aside around 10-20 cloud functions that we can execute within KBVE by the end of the year.
- 3:00pm - Almost had to sell around 400 shares of $TSLA at $215.00 mark, but I extended that mark to next week to $230. Hopefully I can keep the extension going before having to sell shares. Ideally we get a small pull back from the markets but we shall see, that $428 on the SPY is definitely something that I was not expecting. I might try to enter a position in $AAPL next week with a covered put.
- 7:00pm - I started to build out the automated cloud deployments for my functions but there are still some issues that I need to address. Getting the NET Code and Python deployment out of the way might be the most important thing to tackle this month, so I can start to run those functions within the cloud.
- 9:00pm - Reviewed and started to take notes on the security within the cloud function deployment, I believe that the final step would be to integration between a payment / credit system and the the deployment of the cloud functions, then we have a full SaaS system!
