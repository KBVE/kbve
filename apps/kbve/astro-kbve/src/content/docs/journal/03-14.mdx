## 2025

### Foundation

-   06:00AM

    Watched the whole first season of foundation and it hit that firefly and expanse urge that has been in my soul.
    There really needs to be more sci-fi shows like this, filled with space drama and galactic battles, oh boi!

-   11:30PM

    Season 2 already, we are going to finish this show up way too quick.
    Complacency is still a bit of an issue that I need to resolve while watching that need.

### Nvdia Tar Rifts

-   04:37PM

    Good to see the markets recovery a bit over all of this non-sense.
    From the outside perspective and looking into the scale of this issue, everything is going through a fire sale.
    If you are young, this is a great time to pick up investments but also to be safe with emergency funds.
    On the brightside, my puts did expire and that nets me a couple thousand, which I will roll into the CD.


### WellsFargo CD

-   11:40:AM

    The CD account has matured and I have to decide what to do with the funds.
    I am thinking of moving them to a new account, but I am not sure which one to move them to.
    The goal of the CD funds is to get to 100,000 reserve that will collect that nice 4% interest.
    Afterwards, I might move the funds into picking up a condo?


## 2024

### Twitch

I am thinking that once the this new PC is fully operational that I should prepare my exisiting twitch account too.

I been slacking on the streaming front, I just do not have enough content to entertain a stream long enough, but that might just be my own writers block.
They do say that the biggest enemy is one's mind.



### Appwrite

The `schema.ts` is missing some of the base templates that we would need for an appwrite instance!

I will go ahead and write them out slowly and have GPT double check them for me.

### Travel

The next gamejam starts within this weekend and its the travel jam!
The game could be named that `Davids Goliath`, granted we can not yet start the jam because its about 7 hours early since I last added this line.

We are still allowed to plan the game out.



### Shell

To finish up the shell integration for the nextjs project, we want it to clean the files and move the build files to the embed location.
The same way that we handled the previous WASM build, so we know where we have to go.

These are the results from the `./kbve.sh -build react-phaser-fish-chip` :

```

(!) outDir /home/h0lybyte/kbve/kbve/dist/apps/react-phaser-fish-chip is not inside project root and will not be emptied.
Use --emptyOutDir to override.

../../dist/apps/react-phaser-fish-chip/index.html        0.37 kB │ gzip:   0.25 kB
../../dist/apps/react-phaser-fish-chip/fish-chip.js  1,969.38 kB │ gzip: 484.77 kB

```

We can actually just avoid using the shell and pass through that empty outdir command! Yay!
That ended up being easier to manage than I would have thought.

### David Goliath

The travel tag might be a bit weird but also these notes for this year , 2024, will extend into the next day because its almost 3:39am here.
