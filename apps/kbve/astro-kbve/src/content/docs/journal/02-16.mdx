## Notes

## 2025

### GameJam

-   04:54PM

    A terrible mistake was made, I mixed the game jams up between the Godot Wild and Nothing Can Go Wrong. 
    Now I will have to find a way to build the game using both themes, hmm.
    The only thing that keeps coming to me my head is a chess-like game.

### TowerDefense WebView Wry

-   06:21PM

    While I should be preparing for the gamejam, I been stuck on this windows webview bug and its been getting super annoying!
    This feeling is terrible because it works fine on mac and I was really hoping that it be the other way around.

-   08:26PM

    Slowly breaking each part of the function down and it seems that the borrowing of the window handler is giving us some issues.
    Seeing the words window and handle over and over is going to cause my brain to explode.
    Turns out the issue was that webview requires additional linking in a gnu dll target, ugh.

## 2024

### Journal

I am going to test case the new renders of the journal entries within the migrated kbve.com.

The color scheme is already making the text a bit hard to read but I suppose keeping the default white font is the best move, then adding a couple hues of blue.

The next question that I have in my mind is how would I go about doing the color gradients?

The color palette that I am thinking might look something like this:

Main Color , base cyan
- Hex: `#91ffff`
- RGB: `(145,255,255)`

Additional colors
- Hex: `#08a4a7	(8,164,167)`
- Hex: `#e9ffff	(233,255,255)`
- Hex: `#4dfed1	(77,254,209)`
- Hex: `#0bdbb6	(11,219,182)`

These are not the final colors but give us a bit of range to understand how it would look.

We do need to create a new logo around these colors as well, which I will assign to an agent.


### Security

There are some older journal notes for security, we have to migrate them over to the new monorepo.

The two subjects as of right now are just `xss` and `firewall`, but we could include some additional subjects?

I think an entry for auth should be included as a future aspect, including how to handle jwt, password reset and 2fa.
