### ClickHouse Postgres

-   04:59PM

    Integration is complete, we are able to query!
    Our quick command to connect to the service is this below:

    ```shell
    talos -n clickhouse port-forward svc/clickhouse-clickhouse-cluster 9000:9000 8123:8123
    ```

    For our quick query, we will do this:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM postgresql(supabase_postgres, schema='auth', table='identities');
    ```

    This will be a quick test case to make sure that everything works between the external secret and our current query.

**Unity**

I been diving deeper into Unity 6, preparing the different plugins and getting ready for the stable release next week.
Since we have about a week to prepare, I am going to go ahead and test more plugins with the pre-release!

**OneJS**

Out of all the plugins that I have installed, it seems that `OneJS` is already setup to be used on unity 6 aka 6000.
This plugin will help us build some general UI systems using tailwindcss, but those ui components might not work on a mobile release.
I am thinking the rare icon game should be released for just steam and we can wrap back around with a new game in the future for mobile.
Or if we need to release to mobile, I can just replace the UI with Unitys library, probably hire a developer to do it for us.

**Auth**

For the Supabase Auth, we will have to finish up the generic endpoint and then build around it.
