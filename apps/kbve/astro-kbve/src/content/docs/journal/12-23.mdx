#### Unity DOTS Prefab

-   05:50PM

    Taking a look at Fudster's recent push to resolve the DOTS prefab issue.
    I am hoping that he got it, then I will look at fixing the movement on the map.
    It seems that this is a bandaid because the hybrid render is being applied to everything. 
    Now the other issue is that collision might not work because of that, since gameobjects use a different physics component.
    We will need to figure out a way to convert it over.

### KBVE Main Site

    Updating the 404 Error pages so that they no longer give a blank 404 page.
    Later on we can look at improving the pipeline flow.
    Okay the 404 page no longer fails and loads without issues.

    **Docker**

    Before building out the helm chart, we want to make sure that the docker build is good to go.
    We need it to be published and then have the ability to pull that docker image from the hub before we can move forward with the helm chart.
