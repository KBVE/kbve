## Notes

## Tasks

## 2025

### Supabase Updates

-   09:35AM

    The Supabase image for Kilobase is starting to fall behind in updates, ugh, it might pose some security issues.
    I am thinking that we would have to finish fixing the kilobase extension but we should be able to update the base image before having to do that.

-   10:31PM

    We also have to update the pgrx version that the kilobase extension is using and we need to loop back around at fixing the tokio issues.
    Since I been using the tokio library in godot, I been getting a better understanding on how to handle the multi-threading!
    One of the mistakes that I made was using the crossbeam crate to handle communication, but I think using the tokio libraries to handle that would make more sense xD.

-   EOD

    Okay, upgrading the docker base image to 15.8.1 and then running the generic build using this command:

```shell

 ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:container

 ```

    Afterwards, going to switch the day!

    `FROM supabase/postgres:15.1.1.78 AS kilobase` to `FROM supabase/postgres:15.8.1.044 AS kilobase` is a huge jump, hopefully nothing breaks.

### RFC

-   06:00PM

    The lava has claimed another soul, this time a poor warlock, who met his fate through nature.
    We stand here today to mourn the soul of a man who stole stones.
    

### League

-   10:25PM

    Time to run another quick match with Shaco, while setting up the new Mac Book Pro.
    After throwing brew up, I need to refresh my mind with some clown antics.

## 2024

### Nanostores

The state management is important for all our applications, I am thinking that it might make sense to migrate it all into its own library.

Right now the state management is in the `astro-ve` sub section but we could migrate that out into its own library? Isolating the types and state management will make it easier to blend data types and move between Astro, React, Phaser, ect...

So the plan is to move the `kbve.ts` , `storage.ts` and a couple of those files out of `astro-ve` and into their own library.

For now we are calling them via `data/scores.tsx` but I can already tell this will not work in the longer term.


### WS

The websocket game.
Getting the sockets to work on the client side and server side will be interesting because I also wanted gRPC to work too.
What I might do is first do the web sockets and then maybe do the gRPC afterwards? 
How far of a multiplayer game do we need to make this? Hmm. 


### Adsense

I hate having to go through all the adsense policy changes, but the big ones seem to be for light content and general lack of flow.

I am thinking I should at least add multiplayer for the Phaser game and try to sneak in a couple different concepts, maybe like a leaderboard and see what we can do from there.
