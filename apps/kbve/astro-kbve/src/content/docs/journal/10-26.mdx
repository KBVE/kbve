### Playful GameJam

-   05:35PM

    Spent the whole day trying to get the UI resolved for the playful gamejam.


## 2024

-   02:33AM

    Time to remove the signalr code and just run with regular websockets for now.

    ```shell 
    pnpm nx run atlas:remove --name signalrcore
    ```

    Now lets rebuild the docker image and make sure everything is back to normal.
    That will be through using:

    ```shell
    pnpm nx container atlas
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -p 8086:8086 kbve/atlas:1.42
    ```

    Okay! Let us add the handshake and see where we go from there.

    **Kube**

    Getting ready to deploy a proof of concept of `Atlas` onto the kubectl.
    We already made a version of it earlier with docker swarm, so switching over to kubes should be easy.

    ```shell
    kubectl config use-context default
    ```
    
    For swapping context between orbstack and the remote kubectl.

    **WebSockets**

    The sun rises as I am fixing up these websockets! Ugh!
    It seems that there is a crash when we go to close out the websockets, I am trying to adjust for it.
    ```json
        {
            "channel": "default",
            "content": {
                "command": "execute",
                "packageName": "net.runelite.client.plugins.microbot.util.security",
                "className": "Login",
                "method": "Login",
                "args": ["myUsername", "myPassword", 301],
                "priority": 1
            }
        }
    ```

    **Java**

    More updates to the buying gf meme plugin, I am thinking that it might make more sense to do a hybrid version.
    Hmm, that or we need to figure out a better way to define the channels when handling the sockets, both are things that we should consider.
    I should make an issue ticket regarding that as well but there is still some time before we move down that path.

    **LCA**

    More updates are on their way for the lc agents, we need to update the issue tickets around them, maybe get a step by step break down of each component.
    There is still some work that needs to be done for the filler content, but I am thinking a timeline that is specific for the markets and agency work?
    This goes into the whole looking for work type of beat, maybe a scrapper for freelance gigs and bounties could work.
