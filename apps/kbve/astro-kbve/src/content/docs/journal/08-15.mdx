## 2024

**Quotes**
The quotes plugin for the journal entries should be similar to how we are doing `itemdb.astro`, where it grabs the front matter quote data and then displays.

**PasteBin**
We should place the a KBVE pastebin as a test case, maybe even include the ability to have it cross post onto the Discord?
There could be additional requirements like password protection via AES?
Ideally this would be a test on our ability to utilize the SQL database and also we do need to test out the transactions against the planetscale model.

**FlyIO**
It seems thast the FlyIO service also seemed to remove their free service, according to them it was because of abuse.
For now they have a `pay-as-you-go` plan and will cover about $5 worth of expenses each month.
Now that I am thinking it would still make sense to at least deploy 3 VMs that would act like cache end points to help offset any heavy load.
The 256mb should be enough for us to handle around 10000 active connections each, so the cache pool would be around 30,000 active connections. 
I will try to formulate a way to call those cache endpoints without having it affect the main script, we could setup a simple client side algo to help with that.
As for the flyio deployments, it should still be all done via the github actions?
We could also make it so that it gets deployed as dev branches, this way we can test case our dev APIs.

## 2023
- 6:00am - Still need to clean a bit of my room up, the only mess that is getting me annoyed is around by work bench. 
- 7:27am - Time to clear up the Layout issue with the MDX files. Oh man, the joys :/
- 8:24am - I should make another patch with the `layout:` killer.
- 7:23pm - I been at this for almost 12 hours and I am still running into random errors, ugh! This day is extremely lame.
