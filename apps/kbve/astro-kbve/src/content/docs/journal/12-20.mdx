    **RPi**

    Maybe the image that we used before was wrong? It could be that the documentation or the notes are wrong as well, hmm, I am still a bit stuck on how that came to be.
    Ugh, I am going to have it call it quit because its just too annoying, maybe I can come back around.
    Each image that I am building is either not bootable or there is something that I am missing, hmm.

    **Park**

    After cleaning myself up, I decided to take a bit of a break and walk around the park.
    It was so cold that my balls were deep inside, begging to go back to the heat.
    In the future, I should have dressed better and maybe wear the heated vest?
    Cyberpunk is the flow.

    **Food**

    I am going to make some quick ramen again, but this time using some of the brooth from yesterday.
    I let it sit with some fresh peppers, peas and carrots, so I know they are all going to be nice little spicy bombs.

    **Work**

    Ended up being way too lazy today and should cut that behavaior out!
    I got a whole wife and kids to take care of, xD just kidding, okay next is making sure the new kanban database schema works.
    I know that it will give us the ability to save but there are a couple safety concerns that I need to figure out with the sql.
