## Notes

<Adsense />

## 2025

### Markets

-   09:31AM

    The tariffs gave everyone a nice dip to average cost around!
    I am looking to pick up a couple more NVDIA this week but if not, then I will keep the put profits.

### Supabase

-   12:02PM

    The `kilobase` has been a bit out-dated and needs a couple upgrades to the base supabase extension.
    I should be careful with how I approach this upgrade because we also need to fix the custom wrappers too?
    Taking on the `kilobase` project with the additional projects that I have right now might be a bit painful to balance as well.

### Rust

-   10:40AM

    Adding Serde will be important for our rust project.
    
-   12:37PM

    We can extend out the `UxUiElement` to include a function that would take in the `GString` from Godot and convert it over to the json, via serde.
    The function would look like this:

    ```rust

    impl UxUiElement {
        pub fn from_json(json_str: &str) -> Result<Vec<Self>, serde_json::Error> {
            serde_json::from_str(json_str)
        }

        pub fn from_gstring(json_gstr: GString) -> Result<Vec<Self>, serde_json::Error> {
            let json_str = json_gstr.to_string();
            Self::from_json(&json_str)
        }
    }

    ```

    This would make it easier for us to move from `GString` -> `String` ->  `str`, then in the future we can go back around and just replace that all with `Binary`?
    Using json for now to make things easier and then for performance, we can go back around and add a function to help us with the binary movement.
    In my notes, I will also include a note for `ULID` / `Binary(16)` mapping too, so that the json data is not passed around multiple times but just a hashmap that stores it all.
    This can be useful for caching and creating more complex data structures, but I might be going way too ahead of myself.

-   01:41PM

    Okay, the menu system was refactored to take the data in as json, but I am thinking that we could also optimize the allocation.
    Instead of creating new buttons each time through allocation, we could have a pool of uxui elements that we can grab and recycle?
    However that might not be worth it for now, we can come back around to it later on.

-   02:17PM

    After some quick thinking, it might make sense to create another hashmap that stores all the `ui`-elements, maybe a `ui-cache` that we can use and consolidate all the `Gd<Control>` into.
    Okay before moving forward with the `ui-cache`, I need to adjust the `JSON` from the GDScript to avoid some issues with the stringfy.
    I will handle it while I am in the car.

### Godot

-   02:33PM

    Windows build testing should start soon, there might be some issues that I need to resolve with the `rcedit`, but it would be wise to start the pipeline for it.
    The goal will be to get a steam playable out really soon and push it up into the store?
    I think it be a great treat to have the godot rust game out there for people to try, then we wrap back around and see how it works in unity.
    Having a whole new area to tackle might be interesting but also a bit dangeorus, just a side note for me.


### Floor796

-   12:35PM

    Was venturing around the internet and came across this website, https://floor796.com/#t3r3,268,593, and I think it be perfect for this journal entry.
    Maybe I will make it a habit to visit the site once a year, just to see what updates have been added to it.

## 2024

### Unity

After storing the UserData's JWT, we need to pull the player stats and general location from previous save.
The base of the character profile table currently would look like this:

```javascript

export const characters = mysqlTable('characters', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
	ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16}).unique().notNull(),
	userid: binary("userid", { length: 16}).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
	
});

```

Yet we need to expand the table to include not only the current stats but the original max stats.
So we should keep the `hp` column for the max health and `mp` for the max mana.
Then the `health` and `mana` would hold the current session's data within the game.
Next would be energy, which needs two names as well for the column, hmm.
`ep` will be the term for Energy points which is the max energy that they have, while `energy` is the current session for the energy.

Side note: Within the Schema.rs, most of these will be transported to Integer, so we will not have to worry too much about it on the gRPC endpoint.

The exp / reputation is currently held under the `users` table, yet I am thinking that we can have them seperated because there would be multiple characters.
The guild would have its own exp/rep and each character then would have its own internal.

The current table would look like this:

```javascript

export const characters = mysqlTable('characters', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
	ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16}).unique().notNull(),
	userid: binary("userid", { length: 16}).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
	hp: int('hp').default(0).notNull(),
	mp: int('mp').default(0).notNull(),
	ep: int('ep').default(0).notNull(),
	health: int('health').default(0).notNull(),
	mana: int('mana').default(0).notNull(),
	energy: int('energy').default(0).notNull(),
	armour: int('armour').default(0).notNull(),
	agility: int('agility').default(0).notNull(),
	strength: int('strength').default(0).notNull(),
	intelligence: int('intelligence').default(0).notNull(),
    name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    description: varchar('description', { length: 255 }).notNull()
});

```

For status effects like being poisoned, stunned or getting a buff, we will most likely have to create a couple new tables.

Example of the status table:

```javascript

export const status = mysqlTable('status', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(), // Adding ULID for the status type
    name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    description: varchar('description', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
});

```

This table would not change too often but it would help us keep track of the different types of status from a fundamental level?
Hmm I will think it through, so then the `effects` table would be something similar to this:


```javascript

export const effects = mysqlTable('effects', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(), // ULID for each effect instance
    cid: binary('cid', { length: 16 }).references(() => characters.cid).notNull(), // Reference to characters' ULID
    statusUlid: binary('status_ulid', { length: 16 }).references(() => status.ulid).notNull(),
    startTime: datetime('start_time').notNull(),
    duration: int('duration').notNull(),
    intensity: int('intensity').default(1).notNull(),
});

```

Wait! Okay there was an issue that I just realized with referencing the characters, which is by placing the character under a ULID!
Instead we should update the table to be a `cid` aka character id that is a ULID but keeping the column name the same will help with inner , left, right joins because they would not only share the same value but reference.

So the final character table would be:

```javascript

export const characters = mysqlTable('characters', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
	cid: binary('cid', { length: 16}).unique().notNull(),
	userid: binary("userid", { length: 16}).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
	hp: int('hp').default(0).notNull(),
	mp: int('mp').default(0).notNull(),
	ep: int('ep').default(0).notNull(),
	health: int('health').default(0).notNull(),
	mana: int('mana').default(0).notNull(),
	energy: int('energy').default(0).notNull(),
	armour: int('armour').default(0).notNull(),
	agility: int('agility').default(0).notNull(),
	strength: int('strength').default(0).notNull(),
	intelligence: int('intelligence').default(0).notNull(),
    name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    description: varchar('description', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
	experience: int('experience').default(0).notNull(),
    reputation: int('reputation').default(0).notNull(),
});

```

That will make the cid the unique character id for the game!
Okay now we need to make some changes to the effects table to maintain a better structure for future inner joins.

Updated the effects table, so this is a quick reference to it:

```javascript

export const effects = mysqlTable('effects', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(), // ULID for each effect instance
    cid: binary('cid', { length: 16 }).references(() => characters.cid).notNull(), // Reference to characters' cid
    status: binary('status', { length: 16 }).references(() => status.ulid).notNull(), // Reference to status.ulid
    startTime: datetime('start_time').notNull(),
    duration: int('duration').notNull(),
    intensity: int('intensity').default(1).notNull(),
});

```

After the status / effects, I should look into the skill and ability tree?
I am thinking of following a structure that would be similar to WoW talents or DnD feats but I will keep doing research.
Then there is equipment and inventory, but I will do that with credit and banking, so hmm, I suppose guild, achievements and customization?

I could keep those empty for now and then expand upon them later on.

Starting the new character off with 0 health means that it would trigger a death animation / death event from the start.
I am wondering if that makes sense? Hmm, also I am not storing the position of the character directly under the Character table, but rather have a new table to handle that.

If the character is in multiple games, there should be a way to keep track of the position without having overwrites, I am also thinking about this as I am writing.

Okay. Option 1 would be just storing the x,y and z into the character table, but we already know from previous experience that this would be terrible for performance and also for the logical problem.

Option 2 would be to create a metaphysical table that we could use to store the location relative to the game that the character is playing, thus having multiple locations saved based upon the game.

Here is the base of the metaphysical table:

```javascript

export const metaphysical = mysqlTable('metaphysical', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    cid: binary('cid', { length: 16 }).references(() => characters.cid).unique().notNull(),
    posX: float('posX').notNull(),
    posY: float('posY').notNull(),
    posZ: float('posZ').notNull(),
    transport: int('transport').default(0).notNull(), // 0 could represent 'on foot' or no transportation
    // Additional fields for state or other dynamic character aspects can be added here
});


```

Well, almost, lets just quickly adjust some of the variables a bit.
In addition, we might want to make the cid an unqiue because there should be only one metaphysical row per character aka per cid.
We will maintain a one-to-one relationship between the metaphysical and the character, just to be on the safe side for now.
We also might want a ulid for the metaphysical table, just to be safe, when trying to move the data around multiple databases, it will help with the integrity.
Here is the updated table below:

```javascript

export const metaphysical = mysqlTable('metaphysical', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(), 
    cid: binary('cid', { length: 16 }).references(() => characters.cid).unique().notNull(),
    posX: float('posX').notNull(),
    posY: float('posY').notNull(),
    posZ: float('posZ').notNull(),
    transport: int('transport').default(0).notNull(),
});

```

The `id` would be a serial primary key for performance, while the `uild` would be for data integrity amoung multiple databases.
Next the `cid` would be a binary reference to the character data, and it should be an unique reference, thus a one-to-one instead of a one-to-many or many-to-one.
The `pos` of X,Y,Z would be the position of the character within the metaphysical world.
The transport being `0` would be fine for this instance.

I believe we could also set the world and plane, but I need to double check my notes to make sure I do this part right.

We do want the characters to be able to move between world and different planes of space, but getting the math and the data structure down can be a bit of a pain.

Thinking that through, it might make sense to create another table before we do the metaphysical table, with that table being the one that handles the worlds.

Considering that the worlds can have a set amount of planes, we might have to adjust for that as well within the world table.

This is the current worlds table:

```javascript

export const worlds = mysqlTable('worlds', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(),
    name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    createdBy: varchar('createdBy', { length: 255 }).notNull(), // Could be 'player' or 'server'
    creatorId: binary('creatorId', { length: 16 }), // Nullable, references the user ID if created by a player
    description: varchar('description', { length: 255 }),
   });

```

Some changes that we can make would be the `ulid` column and maybe expanding the columns to include some additional information about the world?

So we can shift the ulid to `wid` , which would be a ulid but for the world id.

That means changing the `ulid: binary('ulid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(),` to:

`wid: binary('wid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(),`

and then updating the metaphysical table with a direct reference.

`wid: binary('wid', { length: 16 }).references(() => worlds.wid).notNull(),`

The cleaned up version of the worlds would be then:

```javascript

export const worlds = mysqlTable('worlds', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    wid: binary('wid', { length: 16 }).unique().notNull(),
    name: varchar('name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    userid: binary('userid', { length: 16 }).notNull(),
    description: varchar('description', { length: 255 }).notNul(),
    dimensionality: int('dimensionality').default(3).notNull(),
   });

```

We can ommit the `complexDimensions: json('complexDimensions').notNull()` for a later time period.

Part of the reasoning for leaving the complex dimensions behind is because we need to test case the Unity build for Andorid / iOS via react native and see how far we can push the view screen.

We could include a `planes` for the complex structure, which would be something like this:

```javascript

export const planes = mysqlTable('planes', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
    wid: binary('wid', { length: 16 }).references(() => worlds.wid).unique().notNull(),
    hash: varchar('hash', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
})

```

Then have hash be an indrect reference to an outside reference of the planes. 

Like a crystal field theory, which is E = q1q2/r, base theory with extended d electron orbits.

Okay I am getting a bit side tracked with the planes within a metaphysical world, might be time to take a break.

Leaving the note off on Faith! It seems that I missed that one.

Spaceballs and getting some sleep is the plan for the rest of the night!
