#### Unity Mac Shader Problems

-   01:15AM

    Even after this most recent build, we are running into a shader error.
    However what makes this shader error a major issue is that it does not tell us where it seems to be failing.
    The null point errors and these shader errors are really breaking my mental, I am starting to really feel the pain of game development.
    Each error seems to progress into a whole new error within the eco-system, just takes way too much time to process all of these issues.
    One idea could be to also just drop all the mono and completely switch to DOTS.
    Anyhow, we decided to make an editor script to help us.

### Unity Terrain Shaders

-   11:40PM

    The terrain shaders are still a black void within the DOTS instance.
    Honestly, we got the trees resolved but damn terrain is such a pain, ugh.

    **Kanban**

    Start the morning off with a fresh deployment of the kanban helm chart.
    To build out the chart we need to make sure.
    `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git` This is the repo that we are pulling in and the path is `/migrations/kube/charts/kanban`
    We need to pass in the secrets too, so lets go ahead and resolve that
    ```shell
    ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:seal --namespace=kanban --keyName=aws-config --secrets=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_I
    ```

    The deployment went well and we got the configurations through without any issues!
    Now we can switch back to the react code and figure out how to talk to the main api.
