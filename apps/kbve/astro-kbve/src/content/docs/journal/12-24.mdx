    **Kanban**

    Start the morning off with a fresh deployment of the kanban helm chart.
    To build out the chart we need to make sure.
    `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git` This is the repo that we are pulling in and the path is `/migrations/kube/charts/kanban`
    We need to pass in the secrets too, so lets go ahead and resolve that
    ```shell
    ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:seal --namespace=kanban --keyName=aws-config --secrets=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_I
    ```

    The deployment went well and we got the configurations through without any issues!
    Now we can switch back to the react code and figure out how to talk to the main api.
