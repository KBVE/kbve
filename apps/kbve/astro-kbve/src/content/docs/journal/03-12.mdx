## Notes

## 2025

### Kilobase v15.8.10

-   10:53AM

    It was another day at the remote office, planning or throwing bricks at the computer screen until something would stick.
    The big issue right now is trying to figure out what I can do to improve all that older rust code and get ourselves an established redis proof of concept.
    After the poc is built, I will try to include pg vector and the sol instance extension as well!

-   03:24PM

    The FFI issue that is holding us back right now is the str / String between the redis, rust and postgres.
    The solution might be very simple at first but I can see it becoming a huge problem later on.
    Hmm, I wonder if there might be a better way to handle the redis integration, maybe we could get creative and run our own internal map of the data, like a mini redis.
    This would avoid the connection and jump to the redis, basically maintaining our own internal memory map.

-   05:12PM

    I have been thinking about the redis integration and I think I have a solution.
    I will create a mini redis that will be a part of the kilobase, this will allow us to maintain the data in memory and then sync it with the redis instance.
    This will allow us to avoid the FFI issues and also allow us to maintain the data in memory, which will be faster than the redis instance.
    Hmm, I am writing this a couple times and mapping it out right now, hopefully I can get something going soon.

### Moomin

-   06:26PM

    While watching episode 2, I felt like the show was a perfect representation of questing in Silverpine!
    Wolf and all, it was a perfect representation of the zone, even the death of Fudster was a great representation.

## 2024


### Git

The branch is out of sync, going to try and get it back into sync.

This is a test to see if I blew through the cache on github actions.

It was github! Ugh! They were causing all my issues from their endpoint, oh well its been resolved.


### Supabase

Now back to the main setup and usage of Supabase!

After working through all the specs, I decided that I will hold off on the Supabase integration once more.

This time it is less of the postgres issues but I currently do not have enough resources to actually execute what I need, the revenue stream is not high enough to justify the amount that I would be burning on API calls.
