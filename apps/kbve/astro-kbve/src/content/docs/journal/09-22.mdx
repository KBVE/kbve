### Github Workflows

-   08:20PM

    Need to adjust the workflows for a couple of the github actions because they are a bit outdated and need some tweaks.
    When going to the workflows on the github repo, they do not display their name and that might be because I am missing something.
    For example, we have this issue with the workflows, where it shows "Rust DLL Tower Defense Build" as ".github/workflows/rust-dll-tower-defense-build.yml".
    I find that to be a bit annoying and really confusing, so maybe I need to wrap the name in quotes.

### Moving away from WebGL on RI

-   09:18PM

    Officially we ware no longer going to support the webgl build for the RareIcon.
    As we continue to build out the steam game, maybe once the demo is out and we have positive feedback, we could begin Android/iOS.
    For now, the focus will be just to get popular enough on Steam.

### Jobless Animu

-   11:59PM

    Time to finish up the second season of the show since its just been sitting on my todo list.
    After I can finish that up, I can cross that out of my ever growing rewatch.
    I did want to finish silicon valley and then finish up mr robot afterwards. 
    Maybe I could do some security work while watching the robot show, it would match perfectly.

## 2024

**Fleet**

4am, fleet, fleet, fleet, mental beats.
Okay, after dunkin my head deep into the water, some quick waterboarding and we can move forward.
I believe I need to add the paths to the additional folders, hopefully that should resolve some of the sealed secret issues.
Okay so we ended up just moving it into the templates folder, what a terrible waste of a night.
Anyhow, next we need to adjust the redis labels so that the data gets exported out.
The redis exporter also might need a password when its exporting out the data, so lets try to include that in this situation too.
Now that I am looking back at the issue, it might be within the realm of the configuration of the exporter, since we are using bitnami charts, it might be under the metrics label.
Let us go ahead with updating that part and see if it deploys!
A decent chunk of these errors are just because of a bit of mismatch with the type of older docker swarm stacks and the latest charts.
I believe this will start to get even more complex once we start to import more 3rd party charts.

**Redis**

Our goal for now is to make sure that the data for the redis instance will be displayed inside of the native grafana.
Changing the `name` to `name: redis-armada-monitor` so that it be eaiser to double check the logs.
After getting a nice fresh start of the day, I am back at the bench, doing more of the `redis metrics memes`.
The next update will be around `redis-service-monitor.yaml`, I believe the issue might be in the `relabel_configs`? or the `matchLabels`?.
Well the only way to find out is by continuing to mess around with the fleet, keep-on learning!

For the `redisLegendInput: 'Redis Input'` and `redisLegendOutput: 'Redis Output'`, I think it would make sense to just strip them out and move them directly into the configmap.
Next maybe we can pass through the `redis.addr: redis-master:6379` into the env variables and see if that can help with the values.yaml?

We know the metrics are running because we ran this command:

```shell

kubectl port-forward svc/redis-metrics 9121:9121 -n armada

```

**RBAC**

Maybe the issue was not the redis or prom, but rather the rbac?
Let us look at the options for adding them into the fleet stack.
These are the base YAML configurations for the RBAC that we are looking at:

```yaml

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: armada
  name: prometheus-scrape
rules:
- apiGroups: ["monitoring.coreos.com"]
  resources: ["servicemonitors"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

---

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: prometheus-scrape-binding
  namespace: armada
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: prometheus-scrape
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: prometheus
  namespace: cattle-monitoring-system

```

All of this was overkill, it was a simple 2-3 lines and we are now good to go!
