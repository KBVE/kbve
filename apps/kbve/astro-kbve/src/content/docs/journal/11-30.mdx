    **Secrets**

    To add our sealed secrets, we will have do a couple things ahead of time before we can do it.
    First we need to update our code to accept the env variable for the discord client and discord secret.
    Both of these will be used for discord sdk communication but we also need to create the sealed secrets too for the fleet.

    The rust code will look like this:

    ```rust
    static ENV_VARS: Lazy<HashMap<&'static str, String>> = Lazy::new(|| {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(
        "DISCORD_CLIENT_ID",
        std::env::var("DISCORD_CLIENT_ID").expect("DISCORD_CLIENT_ID not set"),
    );
    map.insert(
        "DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET",
        std::env::var("DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET").expect("DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET not set"),
    );
    map
    });
    ```

    The idea here would be to create a static map that holds these two variables because we only write once , but read many.
    This static block will just focus on the first write.

    ```shell
    ./kbve.sh -nx rust_rareicon_gameserver:orb
    ```

    **Seals**

    While working on that docker build test, we can run this to generate the seals.

    ```shell
    ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:seal  --namespace="rareicon" --keyName="DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET" --secrets="DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=pepethefroog"
    ```

    **Helm**

    Time to update the docker image for the helm chart and see if we can get the discord oauth / token / login out of the way.
    Inside of the `axum-gameserver.yaml` , we will manually update the rareicon game server image with this hash:
    `image: "kbve/rareicongs@sha256:32fecd31c9d84b002455fc6e10fbdf26d8d693521774b940e3d658d2eb281b5b"`

    I would do this via tag systems but the number of deployments would drive me crazy, or well further insane, or well to the edge of escapism.

    **AiBrain**

    We are going to start building out the whole ai brain again but something that we can use just directly through the C# code.
    This way we can work on the ai brain without having to mess around directly with unity.
    Furthermore, this allows us to use this ai code in future projects as well.
