    **Legal**

    I forgot to include my notes on the legal document situation, since we need them for the steam release and the discord activity release.
    Since both are important, let me look through the notes and figure out the best option for them.
    Inside of the `astro.config.mjs` we need to add the legal directory, which should be easy.
    After adding the configuration, we will migrate the `mdx` into the `docs` folder.

    **WebSockets**

    Now that we got the websockets working, we can start moving forward with the multiplayer and chat.
    The best way that we can approach this would be to start small and build around it.
    Furthermore, we could also add the discord bot into the workflow too but that might make our build just a bit larger?
    There are some interesting points that we can look into but for the most part, I think we will just rawdog and run into it all blind.

    **Auths**

    For the auth system, we would need to include a couple sealed secrets for the client id and client password, specifically the discord information.
    I am thinking that we could also build it around just a global secret that then pulls those secrets from the vault?
    Both ways could work but for now, since we do not have a vault system fully functional, we will just stick with a basic sealed secret.
