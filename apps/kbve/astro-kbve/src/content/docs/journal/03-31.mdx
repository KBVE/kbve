## Notes

## 2025

### Adsense Routing

-   11:40AM

    Adsense income will be extremely important as the NET 60 cycle starts to get into motion.
    As the payments come in, we need to make sure we have them go towards the right projects and funds!
    I am going to keep this here as a note, so that when I loop back around to this entry, I can go back and make sure everything moves in the right flow.
    Each deposit has to then set aside an amount for the taxes, then sit another portion aside for equipment and business costs.
    Getting the projections and the cycle started and in full force is a bit tough because the earnings are still swinging too much for each day.

### Bills on Bills on Bills

-   05:25PM

    After finishing all the payments for this month, I noticed that the surplus is a bit too high.
    We are sitting at around a couple bucks that we were not expecting, I believe it might be from the `discord` sale, maybe I forgot something?
    A massive surplus after a couple years is always a bit interesting, hmm.


### March

-   06:09PM

    End of the month, the bills are always coming through!
    The decisions that I will make this year will be important, one of them will be to unload a large amount of the domains that I hold.
    My plan is to unload and quickly sellf off around half of the domains that I have, with the goal of reducing yearl costs of renewing and also getting capital back upfront.
    The capital that I get will go straight back into REITs, that I will be holding forever.

### CICD

-   06:28PM

    As we reverted back to the `main` and `dev` branch, I wanted to loop back and start using re-usable workflows.
    The plan would be to move all changes into these isolated workflows because it will make the management easier in the future.
    Once more, the upfront costs verse future benefits always becomes an issue when it comes to debugging.
    The objection against this is that its really really pushing the over-engineering to the point that it is boarderline insanity.
    However, the skills gained from setting this up and continuing to push the boundries will out weigh anything that I am doing right now.

-   06:37PM

    Azure failed during the first run, I will have to loop back around and see where it failed?!
    It seems that there are two point of failures that I see from the logs, the first would be maybe the azure token parsing was incorrect.
    Or the second issue could be that the information for the azure location is wrong.
    Let me take a momenet and look back at the older workflow that this was based off of.
    Yup, I passed the wrong token, going to update the workflow again.

-   08:12PM

    Preparing the 2nd test and hopefully we can figure out the next problem in our pipeline.
    Let me start the next trigger once more, updating the unity version to avoid that recent build failure.
    Ah, another failure was the mismatch in the unity version, patched it now.

### gRPC Disoxide

-   10:11PM

    Time to take a quick break from the Unity pipeline and finish up the gRPC for Disoxide!
    Before we make that change, I need to update the jedi crate to v0.2.
    Ugh, I will have to also loop back around and look at updating the holy crate too.

## 2024

### KBVE

I spent most of the day fixing up the front page and learning about a couple different libraries.
I hate having to rebuild our website all over again from scratch, but it seems that it might be the best move to help us moving forward with a production ready site.
While I am building the site out, I also started to process the migration of rent earth to the monorepo, as well as a couple secret projects that I want to launch this summer.


### Hardware

I might have to take a break from the software side, mainly the front-end and go either back to doing backend or maybe an embedable device?
The UX/UI session is always fun but doing responsive design can become annoying and a huge time waste, definitely when minor screen aspects become super annoying!
For hardware, I am most likely going to focus on the flipper zero or maybe an orage pi cluster? Hmm, I will have to think it through and maybe land on a robot?


### GameJam

Preparing for the Discord App 2024! We will be building a 3D style game and hopefully we get far with the build?!
There might be concerns with how the project will go but I am thinking we can get far, as long as we focus on the mission at hand.

### CodePen

There are three really cool and amazing codepens that I found!

- https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/gWWQgb
- https://codepen.io/konstantindenerz/pen/poYVOpv
- https://codepen.io/yudizsolutions/pen/bGzKbwm

All of the three were amazing! I am thinking of taking them apart and adding them into the Astro VE library as a reference for future projects.
