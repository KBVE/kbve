## Notes

## 2025

### Godot Wry Build

-   03:50AM

    Ended up staying up way too late at night trying to figure out the build situation.
    Sleepless nights, and there are two more routes that we can take. 
    First would be to have github actions build the rust dll using the msvc target, while the second choice would be to use a docker image to do it.

### Wry Resize

-   03:56AM

    Now the wry window does not resize everytime we change the screen size, that will be next to resolve.

### CI Rust MSVC

-   04:48PM

    Github action runner for the rust dll had some outdated actions, going to update them.
    In addition to the version change, the notes in the `rust` section should be updated to reflect it.

-   08:39PM

    Updating the MSVC github action again, the most recent issue was that we forgot to include the nightly as a rust-src.
    This next update will include and I will adjust the path for upload to be exactly where the DLL is exported.

-   10:07PM
    
    The rust dll build went as planned, it was definitely smaller too compared to the gnu build.
    That means we can continue the production of the extension, yet I should create a cycle where it automatically updates the extensions on our behalf.
    Point of climax here will be once we get more git automation running within our repo, I am going to be super excited to see that level of looping.

### Jedi - User Agents

-   05:14PM

    New issue ticket for the jedi crate, the goal being that it would provide a custom user agent upon requested.
    Example of a user agent string:
    `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/133.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`.
    The goal would be to generate a couple of these that would be cross platform and easy for us to use in the future.
    I suppose we could also make this a typescript library too, for client side generation.

### Brackeys13

-   09:23PM

    Preparing the HTML export for the gamejam, we should not be too far from getting the rest of the pipeline going.
    Next we need to figure out how to handle the UIUX for the game, this time keeping it all within gdscript.


## 2024

### Snow

The late winter has stuck once more!
I actually enjoy the late night snow because it creates such an amazing white morning, seeing everything under a blank of snow.

### Drawer

Okay! For the new menu, we want to have multiple drawers that open on the right side of the website with slots to help control the data that gets render inside of them.

There are a couple different ways that I am thinking we could do it but we will start with the flowbite user interface because we have the library already setup.

I might also try to include a R3F version but that might end up becoming way too large.

Got the right side of the drawer to be functional, now I need to adjust how it would look by utilizing the tailwindcss configuration.
My first through process would be to just assign basic hex codes for the different tailwindcss variables, however I am also thinking of extending out the dynamic coloring option, but what would be the best way to handle that?

I also added a simple dynamic id system and simple text naming scheme.

```js


// Helper Function for replacing Hyphens and the word Drawer
function replaceHyphensWithSpaces(inputString: string) {
  return inputString.replace(/-/g, ' ').replace(/drawer\s?/gi, '');
}

let idText: string = 'PlaceHolder';

// Check if `id` is not provided or is an empty string
if (!id) {
    console.warn('Warning: The "id" prop is missing or empty when calling the Astro Flowbite Right Component.');
} else {
    idText = replaceHyphensWithSpaces(id);
}

```

This will help with making sure the id prop is passed and also let us create a dynamic `idText` from the same id that gets passed.

For the background color, I am thinking of just passing through the `kbve-menu-bg` variable, but this means that the component will not have dynamic light and dark mode.

We could resolve that right now by adding an additional property that gets passed, for this concept we could call it a `dyn` boolean, which would enable a couple types of dynamics.

Let me update the `Props` to pass in the dynamic boolean, 

```ts

export interface Props {
    id?: string;
	img?: string;
    dyn?: boolean;
}

const { img, id, dyn = false } = Astro.props;

```

Afterwards, we will have to add in a helper function to handle the dynamic colors for the form. 

There are a couple options we could include but I think we can isolate it just within this component, rather than creating more sub-libraries.

We want to adjust the SVG colors, using a primary color and we should include a dynmaic class incase we want to alter the color of the svg using javascript.

There will be two more tailwindcss variables that we will be using, `kbve-svg-primary` and then for the dynmaic variable, just adding dyn to the end, `kbve-svg-primary-dyn`.

Going to run a quick health check on the two projects that are using the Astro VE, which can be done by this command:

```shell

./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:build
./kbve.sh -nx herbmail.com:build

```

I did notice the build throw a working with the `register` variable inside of the svelte file, `Register.svelte`, but I will go back and address that issue once I get the base of the form done.

### slots

We will go ahead and remove some of the default flowbite data that is provided by the example and place a couple slots within the drawer, which will hold the content that we want to display.

Oh wait, before I add the slots, we need to make sure that the text is also base and dynamic, similar to how we did the `bg` and `svg`.

Slot breakdown:

- after-description
- after-footer
- after-footer-button

### Style

I am going to create a style interface that I will be call

### Windows

For future reference, incase you need access to the Windows screen during setup, post install, press `Shift + F10` to open the command prompt, then Type `OOBE\BypassNRO` and press Enter.
