### Unity IRC

-   07:43AM

    The goal for the day is to finish up the core proof of concept for an IRC Chat client built into the Unity client.
    I want to isolate the chat from the rest of the game server, so that its easier to monitor and maintain.
    Using the IRC will also let us easily hook into the Discord and Twitch chat too, which could open up future fourth wall concepts.
    Think about a streamer playing RareIcon and having their whole chat become zombies in the game that spawn up and start attacking you!
    We can be very creative with how we want to structure this in the future.

**Secrets** 

The next issue that we have to handle is the `secrets` and its management!
There are a couple options that we can look through but we will start with `sealed_secrets` for now.
After we get the base deployment resolved, we can migrate the secret system to OpenBAO / Vault.
For the commands that we want to run, I am thinking of turning it into a shell file called `sealed_secrets_install.sh`.
This would be the shell script that would install and setup the sealed secrets, but we do want to migrate over to terraform!

The base terraform was created and it was able to install the sealed-secrets!
I included both the shell and the terraform file as an example.
After deploying the sealed secrets installer, we need to run the `brew install kubeseal` and this will help us create the one-way encrypted secrets.

**League**

The league burn out is starting to hit hard, I am getting really tired of the games and might need to switch the pace up a bit.

## 2023
- 6:03am - Currently going through the process of setting up the decentralized file storage but I am not too sure how I should go about handling the meta data engine. I am debating if I should just use the cloudflare egress or maybe switch over to another type of meta storage. 
- 11:15am - I am thinking that it might make sense to create a global redis instance that we could call from any point? There are a couple different ways that I wanted to approach this concept, one being a bit similar to how I was planning to handle the Rust+Redis build / layout. Okay so we could have two instances in this structure, one being the meta and the other just being a general redis? Hmm, I suppose one would be `meta.kbve.com`, the next being `engine.kbve.com` and finally `redis.kbve.com`? This would be the first move before building out the decentralized hybrid swarm. 
- 11:27am - Pushed through some minor updates to the general KBVE repo, now I am currently looking over the appwrite upgrade to v1.4.2, including setting up the clustering! There should not be any major issues that I should face as of right now, but this is going to be an interesting experiment, none the less. Let me see if I could update the existing documentation as well. 
- 11:38am - I believe the first engine that I want to deploy would be the meta, which can then be used by a meta-engine for the storage of the general key-values that will be then used by the scaling redis clusters. The meta engine will be like an index that will reference different data blobs spread across all our containers, virtual machines and emulators! The best option for this engine would be to use the Amazon Elastic Redis instance, yet I am not too sure if we would need to do that as of right now, since one of the goals would be to keep the cost bases as low as possible?
