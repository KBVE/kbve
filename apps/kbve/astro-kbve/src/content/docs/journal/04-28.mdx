### Mystery GameJam

-   11:10AM

    Got an invite to join a game jam for a Mystery game that combines puzzle solving and a visual novel element.
    It is right up my alley but I might not have the time to do it.
    Looking back at my older visual novel code, a complete rework and refresh might be possible with the shared worker libraries that I have recently written.
    On top of that, the new tailwindcss has some of the features that I was looking for, like shadow text and 3D transforms. 
    I told them that I will think about it and get back to them.  

### OpenFront

-   06:45PM

    Enjoying this small RTS io game, it has a bunch of room for improvements but it is fun to play and watch!
    As for what I am thinking, it might be interesting to build something similar in the future, maybe when I want to build in phaser again.


### FlexBuffers Redis

-   07:03PM

    Updating the websockets again to use flexbuffers for the redis streaming.
    The plan is to create a `flex.rs` module that would hold all the flexbuffer related structs and then bridge them to the proto files.
    Afterwards, we can go ahead and build the functionalities for the flexbuffer streaming within redis.


### CowArc

-   08:48PM

    Rewriting the code again but this time I want to focus on a CowArc style, where we wrap the binary in both a cow and an arc.
    Should be good enough for what we want to build!
    Okay actually we can just end up using the bytes crate, so we can just skip the CowArc for now!

## 2024

## 2023

- Currently integrating Svelte into AstroJS, but running into some development problems with Astro v2.3.1? or v2.3.2?. Vite is throwing some errors here and there within the rollUp, so I am currently in the process of debugging that. Afterwards, I aim to integrate AppWrite into Svelte, so that it can execute a bit faster than the current React setup. While React is able to get the basics done, there is a bit of a delay between each action, around ~600ms because it has to communicate with the API (from AppWrites end), I am trying to see if I can resolve that , or at least make it less noticeable via the UX/UI end. One of the aspects I was thinking of was to store the user information locally after login, to have an almost instant load WHILE only having `update` and `delete` require a connection/load.
- `Something went wrong installing the "sharp" module` - Sometimes I hate the sharp module with a passion, I am going to wipe the local installation clean and start fresh from the dev branch. 
- Next issue was that Search via the MDX page was throwing some weird errors and honestly I am a bit too tired to figure out why it was giving a pain. I am assuming its because I forgot something to render or messed up the JSX / react syntax, but to make it easier, I decided to migrate it out of the MDX concept and make it its own .astro page. While I wanted to make it all uniformed via MDX template, certain areas might not be worth the time. Furthermore, I disabled the bing / you searches because they were giving errors of CORS on certain browsers.
- I would say this is a bit of a major update to the website, as I begin to migrate + add more into the framework.
- Under search, I expanded the options and included `reddit.com` and `stackoverflow.com`. The results are not within the iframe but instead they open in new a window/tab; I will gladly add more options/parameters down the line, including expanding into images and GPT/LLVM.
- 8:37pm - It seems that my idea of having a general namespace and then running a custom templating system out of that is just a bit too much. I will go with a more simple widget style and just import the widgets directly, instead of having them all over the place. I just get confused and there just so many options and ways to do things... that it just too much. Sometimes I over-engineer everything and it might not be the best, BUT it was dope to have emoji-style templating, even if it was a complete waste of time, rip 50+ hours I spent lmfao. I did learn and gain so much knowledge from the experience, so it might not have been a total waste.
- 8:40pm - Just saw a dude on a bike get nailed by a tuktuk / rickshaw, he was okay but was driving in the wrong direction and going a bit too fast. Duck the traffic here in India is insane.
