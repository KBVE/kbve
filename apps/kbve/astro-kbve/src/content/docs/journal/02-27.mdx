## Notes

## 2025

### EXPO NativeWind

-   11:30AM

    After spending all that time, it turns out the main enemy was Nx!
    There is an open issue ticket in the Nx repo about how metro is causing problems with NativeWind but I am a bit more happy that I was able to figure it out.
    Nothing feels better than finding out that a dev tool is the cause of all your pain, definitely in the year of 2025.

-   12:29PM

    Huge thanks to [Zack](https://github.com/zackdotcomputer) for providing a working Nx Metro configuration!
    Going to test it out now and see if it solves a couple of the issues that I am facing with NativeWind.

### NVIDIA

-   09:45AM

    Was expecting Nvidia to shoot up, I guess I will keep the call premiums and let it rip.
    The $150 mark seems to be worthless now, maybe we can let it sit until next week and push new calls out.

-   12:25PM

    Brutal $125, if it drops under $120 again, then I will throw some puts up and collect that premium.

### EXPO Library

-   10:10PM

    Time to rewrite the `expo-bbq` but this time for the nativewind build!
    

## 2024

### Gaia

I cleaned up a large chunk of the rentearth repo and now I am currently updating the components within the game engine.
It does feel a bit weird to merge five different games into one final game but everything was modular and it would be like a modular style game?

This might not work as planned but I want to give it a shot, hell it be worth it if I can just get some base demo or proof of concept out there.

The main issue right now is updating Gaia to 2023, which is causing a ton of nullpoint errors! The red text is just across my screen, nonstop xD
This updated package will make adding environmental / terrain easier, as well as, managing the different biomes.

After we get this plugin updated, I will have to loop back to updating all the scenes where we use it.


### Website

While I am building the unity project, I am also using the macbook to build out the final apsects of the website.

We added a couple additional libraries but need to load them via components.

I took some time to write out the different components that we need to add into the AstroVE, basically isolating all of aceternity ui library into the astro ve.

After we wrap around those, we can expand them again after call the Astro VE directly!

There might be a bit of a downside to this approach because we have to be careful on how we handle abstract colors for different websites and themes, but I think we can figure that out as we build it out.
