## Notes

## 2025

### Android SDK

-   04:00PM

    Trying to setup the android sdk again on my WSL instance!
    This should not be so useless and painful in the year of 2025.

-   05:52PM

    The error that I am facing right now is:

    ```

    Error: spawn /mnt/c/Users/Kbvec/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb ENOENT

    ```

    After fixing the android path, so maybe its a tool issue?

### File Watch Error

-   07:24PM

    There was a minor issue with the webpack watching way too many files, I am going to adjust the ignore and maybe that will help with th performance 
    I went ahead and updated the settings for the vscode as well, to ignore some of the node_module folders too.
    Hopefully this will resolve the massive amount of files that are being watched for no reason.

### Monorepo TSConfig.json

-   11:40PM
    
    The current tsconfig is not excluding some of the builds and files, I will have to go through and see what the issue is.
    All of this is causing the WSL's file watcher to become way too resource heavy, ugh.
    I am 100% positive that I am forgetting something, its bound to be simple too.

## 2024


### Git

Going to build out another repo for the unity game!
The current issue that I am facing is within the LFS.

```

Use `git lfs logs last` to view the log.
error: external filter 'git-lfs filter-process' failed
fatal: Assets/X/X/X/X/X.png: smudge filter lfs failed
warning: Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.
You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'

```

In this case, I am going to reclone the LFS and build it from scratch.
If everything works out, then I will place the objects into a new repo.


### HellDiver

Taking a quick break from the Unity development and trying out the new hell diver 2 video game.
