## Notes

## 2026

### CityVote Combat Update

-   04:00AM

    I have decided that it would be best to just work on all the games and projects we have!
    Trying to resolve all the issues, one a time, switching from what could be the most pressing.
    This means that I will bring out the macbook air and get to grinding!

### Unreal Animations Bone Pains

-   12:30PM

    Trying to get the animation bones to change from walking to running or idle, yet there seems to be an issue with the flow.
    I am not too sure where the issue might be, it could be from the C++ side or it could be our material function itself.

### CityVote Website

-   01:10PM

    We should get the astro website up and maybe even sync the accounts from the supabase instance to the godot application.
    I am wondering if that it would then make sense to even build out the stema store too, because we could look at launching this game as a side project for KBVE.
    This is an interesting turn of events, maybe this will be an interesting year, having a bunch of games out for demo release would be great.

### BigMode 2026 GameJam

## 2025

-   **Godot**

    04:44PM

        The cache setup is giving me way too many issues and I will not have much for notes today.
        We are going really quick and trying to get the game ready for the end of the jam.

## 2024

    -   6:05am  -   `Morning`

        #### Morning
        
            The morning routine of getting up early is starting to get to me.
            I am feeling a bit old when I get up xD

    -   9:17am  -   `Rust`

        #### Rust

            Going to do some more early morning Rust coding, just trying to figure out the best way for me to handle the validation.
            I been thinking about how I should handle the validator and maybe we might move it out of the `kbve` package and into its own package.

            Now I need to come up with a name that we would use for this validation builder, yet I believe it should be in its own enity.
            The idea of placing the validation builder into another package that we can call, hmm.

            Okay! The package name that I have decided upon is `jedi` and I believe that will be the place holder for the validation and sanitization that we will be using.
            This package will be shared between the `kbve` aka backend and the front end `erust`, so we have validation on both sides without having issues.
            The `erust` will extend the `jedi` package's ValidationBuilder for its internal structs.
    
            Now I need to fix the pipelines and begin the publishing for the package.


    -   8:35pm  -   `Jedi`

        #### Jedi

            The Jedi package is called `Juggernaut Electronic Data Interchange` and it will be the base for the validations and help maintain a source of truth for the rust structs.
            Besides integrating and utilizing the various EDI standards, like UNEDIFACT, ANSI ACS X12, VDA, ect... 

    -   9:40pm  -   `Movie`

        #### Movie

            A quick movie night with back to back bangers, the first is `Green Book` and then `Whiplash`, both were perfect musical masterpieces.
            I was on the fence with both of them but seeing them back to back is a flow!
