## 2024

**League**
Before getting deep into the programming grind, I am going to quickly throw up a couple quick matches.
Get that RTS/MOBA hit off really quick.

**Debug**
The debug aspect of the game should be handled right now, I think it would make sense to avoid postponing this too far along the dev cycle.
We will extend the user settings to include a debug Boolean to represent the mode and then create a new `debug.ts` to handle the generic problems.
Afterwards, I am thinking of extending it out to create a bug report that can be executed by the player, which will send the information to a github issue ticket? I suppose there are a couple ways we could work that out with the rust-based API. The different parts of my brain are wired and ready, lets go ahead and push through the changes.

**Kill Tony**
I am excited to see who the guests will be for todays kill tony, I expect at least a couple trump jokes all through the set too.
This was an amazing set! I forgot that it was taped right after the debate but the amount of laughs and jokes, definitely one of their best episode yet.
