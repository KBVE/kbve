### Unity Session - ECS

-   10:48PM

    Going to take a quick break from the Godot and focus on the unity side of things, we were able to resolve some of the bridge issues.
    Now we can focus on getting the ECS cleaned up and easier to manage. 

-   11:58PM

    Clearing up a bunch of unity entitiy jobs that are blocking the main thread, which is a bit of a pain to track down but we are getting there!
    Each one will help improve the fps by around 2-5, but they will add up quickly because as we clear them up, we can focus on tracking more and more.

    **Supabase**

    The best way that I can think of integrating supabase might be by making sure that the initial vnc port gets blocked during the docker deployment.
    Only thing that should be open would be the general websocket, hmm.

    **HTML**

    Maybe a solution to the HTML overlay problem is that we need to `window.HSOverlay.autoInit()` the overlay as well?
    I think it might be best to just throw it all away and move onto another issue.
    There has to be a better way to get simple modals with tailwindcss, didnt they create a html5 standard for the modals?

    **Maven**

    Finished going down the pipeline of hell and back for mvn builds.
    A part of me is glad that compiling java has gotten so much better than the previous decade, yet there is another part of me that is a bit sadden with the package times.
    Anyhow, we are just under 60 seconds for the jar build, so there is progress on that end.
    Yet if we can get the mvnd to be added into the build process, I believe we can cut the compile time down to sub 30 seconds.

    **007**

    Starting November off with one of the best double o seven movies!
    It has been such a long time since I have seen any of the classic or new updated series or movies.
    I did not know that octo took place in India, that is kinda low key cool.
