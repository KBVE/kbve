## Notes

Automation for the n8n is done! We are just going through the different endpoints to make sure that it works as planned.

### Markets Post LibDay

-   04:47PM

    Damn, markets just did a back to back 5% drop, which is insane!
    Now the question is when to come in and start to buy cheaper stocks, hmm the chaos is going to be wild.
    We could see another drop next week, once the options start flowing in.

### MiniJinja

-   07:06PM

    The game plan for now is:
    1. Astro build website
    2. Run shell script to replace the commented code with the minijinja.
    3. Then Import the minijinja template.

    After doing some additional research and we could use Askama instead?
    Another option would be to just move into the Disoxus but we still want to keep our astro-like website.

### KBVE

Minor tweaks to the front page! Just to get the general flow out of the way.

The pictures for the slider below are terrible and need to be updated.

The `carousel:highflyer:wave` component was missing the slider varaibles, which would be the images that would be inserted into the gallery.
I am thinking that we put the most basic images that will match the color scheme, mainly with the color of cyan.

For now, I am going to place a bunch of cyan-color based images from unsplash!
In the future, I think we should try to build up our kbve unsplash profile and create a bunch of photographic art for everyone to use.

### Mail

The plan for the day is to research the `mailu` instance!

It seems that the `Mailu` server does not support swarm. 
Here is the issue ticket as a [reference](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions/3128), as it seems the maintainer does not plan on supporting the swarm.
However they do have a k8s setup, so we could go down that route and use that for the mail server.

If Mailu is going to give us a problem, then we can shift over to the `Docker MailServer`, while test casing the `mailu` changes.

Here is the guide that we will be [following and using as a reference.](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/latest/examples/tutorials/basic-installation/)

### 404

The new 404 page will be ready by this weekend but I do need to focus on the Discord App Pitch, which might delay a bunch of progress on the website.
