**Items**

I adjusted the items a bit today, adding a couple from AndSam's Eve Guild Campaign!
After we add a couple more items for Eves guild, we could open up the bar and let users come into it and buy those potions, maybe we can do a barter system.

I am also trying to avoid dumping a bunch of random pixel art without making sure it has an exact usage and with credits.

**Settings**

The next update should be organizing all of the settings into a single interface, making it easier to call through out the game and any future game.
I believe we should also include another function that will wipe all the save data, just to do a clear restart during each session.

```ts

export interface UserSettings {
  tooltipItemId: string | null;
  tooltipItemPosition: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  submenuItemId: string | null;
  submenuItemPosition: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  isStatsMenuCollapsed: boolean;
}

```

Now that I am thinking about it, we could introduce the submenu for the different NPC characters too, upon clicking them and then rendering the actions for them?
This would free up the action menu and make things a bit easier for us to manage.
With that being said, let us go ahead and update the types again but this time something along these lines?

```ts

export interface UserGenericMenu {
  id: string | null;
  position: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
}

export interface UserSettings {
  tooltipItem: UserGenericMenu;
  submenuItem: UserGenericMenu;
  tooltipNPC: UserGenericMenu;
  isStatsMenuCollapsed: boolean;
}

```

Inside of the `localdb.ts`, we went ahead and created the store, like this:

```ts

export const settings = createPersistentAtom<UserSettings>(
  'settings',
  defaultSettings,
);

```

And then added two helper functions, that are setup like this:

```ts

export const getUserSetting = <T extends keyof UserSettings>(key: T): UserSettings[T] => {
  return settings.get()[key];
};

export const setUserSetting = <T extends keyof UserSettings>(key: T, value: UserSettings[T]): void => {
  task(async () => {
    const currentSettings = settings.get();
    settings.set({ ...currentSettings, [key]: value });
  });
};

```

We will be wrapping the set function inside of a task, making it a bit easier in the future to extend out into event and chaining style functions.
One other suggestion was to add a class / factory for it all and then extend it out but I think that might be too much work within this first write.
I will most likely rewrite all of laser again in a couple months, as a trad meme programmer.

**Dice**

Now the next fun begins, which will be to find a way to implement the dice rolling and have it done outside of Phaser.
I am thinking we should do this whole Dice rolling using just React and Three, so that we can utilize this dice rolling in the future and across other applications, like Unity.
After drafting out the dice plans, I was going to originally do a multi-dye , with the option of swapping out different ranges to create that perfect illusion of dice rolling.
Yet for some reason, I felt the need to just use a simple 6 face set of dice, we could adjust the 

We got to this part so far:

```ts 
dice.rotation.set(Math.PI, 0, 0);  // shows 6
dice.rotation.set(0, 0, -Math.PI / 2) // Shows a 5
          dice.rotation.set(Math.PI / 2, Math.PI, Math.PI)  // shows a 4
dice.rotation.set(0, -Math.PI / 2, -Math.PI / 2) // shows a 3
dice.rotation.set(-Math.PI / 2, -Math.PI / 2, -Math.PI / 2)  // shows a 1

 ```

 Getting closer

 ```ts 

   1: new THREE.Euler(-Math.PI / 2, -Math.PI / 2, -Math.PI / 2),          // Face 1 on top
  2: new THREE.Euler(Math.PI / 2, 0, 0), // Face 2 on top
  3: new THREE.Euler(0, -Math.PI / 2, -Math.PI / 2), // Face 3 on top
  4: new THREE.Euler(Math.PI / 2, Math.PI, Math.PI),// Face 4 on top
  5: new THREE.Euler(0, 0, -Math.PI / 2),// Face 5 on top
  6: new THREE.Euler(Math.PI, 0, 0),    // Face 6 on top

  ```

  ## 2023
- 6:00am - After my early morning ritual, I figured it might make sense to do some updates across the board for various projects. I will push through some of the general updates and then sync the repo before I grab my mini-laptop.
- 6:30am - Pushing the sync command and taking a nice break from the house! Early morning touch grass sessions are so relaxing and fun, a great way to start the day.
- 8:00am - While I am in the zone, I am going to layout an effective game plan for myself to quickly do sprints in the form of post-it style issue tickets. I am thinking to compile almost every issue within KBVE, projects and sub-projects into one large kanban. The idea here should be within the scope of keeping each issue / task within the size of a post-it note, minus any technical debt, like links and resources. I should make it a habit of doing this at least once a month, with the idea of keeping certain issues open until they get downsized to smaller ones that can be referenced back to the larger ones? I am rambling a bit here while I type away, but I suppose that is the idea of the journal. Keeping written logs and then typing logs?! Ugh.
- 9:00am - As I am resting in my bed, hoping that I do not take a nap, I am thinking through all the small notes that I made and seeing how far I can push the kanban post-it game plan will be an interesting experiment. 
- 9:20am - Created an issue regarding the A to Z of FinTech. I am going to try and keep dual set of logs, a bit of double accounting style with how I approach each unit within the kanban board. 
- 10:22am - Quickly rolled a SPY $442 call for Monday , quick $50 and rolled 2 TSLA $270 put for $800. Completely forgot to do my Friday specials xD, dumped all that extra cash into O, for about 13 shares, which is another $3.30 additional monthly income. 
- 10:30am - Twitch Mockup / Builder concept notes? Maybe that could be placed into a tools -> stream concept? Where we could generate a bunch of pre-built renders / concepts for people. 
- EOD - n8n is a monster when it comes to debugging certain types of situations, but it seems that I was able to get the duplicate GitHub triggers resolved for now.
