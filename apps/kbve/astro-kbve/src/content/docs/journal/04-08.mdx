## Notes

## 2025

### Markets Tar Rifts

-   04:40PM

    Brutal swing down, just confirming that dead cat bounce theory xD jk jk.
    I was debating to trade SPX earlier this morning but honestly, this is just too wild to keep track off and its worse than a casino at this point.

### Flexbuffers

-   06:14PM

    Damn, even before I could finish the websockets, I am going to postpone it and move forward with the gRPC/FlexBuffers.
    My thought process is that I must have either skipped something or missed something in the documentation, ugh, I am just getting a bit too burnt out trying to figure that out.
    If I refactor the code to include the u8/binary then maybe I could find where the thin command issue might be from?
    As for the event pubsub, we had it working before in the redis / bb8-redis setup, so there might be just a slight change in the logic when using the fred multiplex.
    Step one will be to check the flexbuffer crate that is under the jedi, I think I already did add it but I will double check.


-   08:34PM

    One of the parts that gets a bit confusing is the isolation of the json and binary, since both need to have their own optimizations.
    Had we gone down the path of creating an unified binary, there might be a cost in performance that would not be worth it.
    Thus, we will have duplicate code but it should be worth it in the end.
    There is still room for the MessagePack and Captain, but it might be something that we will have to do much later on.

-   08:56PM

    There will be a split in the Transport Layer and Application Logic Layer that I need to do when figuring out the right paths to take.
    The websocket will take both the JSON and Binary, but as the data comes in, we will have to map and split it, a bit of a highway that takes both cars and trucks.

## 2024


### Python

Time to mess around with python, continuing from yesterday!
I had taken a break from doing anything with the P & Y, that I forgot so many basic things related to the library and language.

### LCA

There are some sections for the LC Agents that need to be updated but within those updates, we need to expand and brush up on the Expo-BBQ library as well!
Ugh so many different libraries that have to be worked on, yet so little time to focus on them all.

To get the base of the `apps/expo-lcagents` started, we will run `./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:serve` and wait for the metro bundler to do its magic.
FYI, the time it takes to bundle and prepare everything is so slow, I can feel the pain from the little javascript engine that could.

We will add the new `about.tsx` section and while doing that, I am going to add a new library called, `expo-linear-gradient`.

To add this library, we will do `pnpm install expo-linear-gradient` and then make sure to setup the expo, iOS, android configurations. In this case, the iOS will need to have the pods rebuilt.

After doing that, we would look at adding more components into the Expo BBQ!

Sadly, I was not able to get a bunch of the different components up within the package today, but instead had to restructure the way that the router functions within expo-lcagents.

I migrated some of the routes into the `tabs` folder and plan to abstract away the navigation to `_nav.tsx`, there was a decent amount of learning to do with expo and react native, but I am getting the hang of it.
