## Notes

Double check the shell execution.

### Expand

-   08:29PM

    I just got a great idea for resolving this panel expanding issue!
    Instead of focusing on just the same panel box growing and shrinking, then having those additional issues, I will just an off canvas panel.
    This off-canvas panel will act as a place holder for any and all modals and components that need to be rendered ontop of the exisiting layers.
    Okay, so that means we will have to figure out the best way to shift over to the panel.
    Hmm, in order to get the panel ready, I will have to also go back around and upgrade the tailwindcss from v3 to v4.
    With this update, it means that kbve.com style will be broken and so will our native wind template.

### Upgrading

-   10:07PM

    The plan is to upgrade the tailwindcss and the additional packages that we have within the `kbve.com` and `native-wind` template.
    We would be upgrading all the tailwindcss internal packages as well, furthermore, we would have to upgrade the Astro to the latest.
    Okay! Time to begin this adventure and lets see how long it takes to get this all done, ugh. 

    Here is the breakdown of the commands that we will be executing:

    Step A0 - upgrading the tailwindcss - `pnpm add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest`
    Step A1 - upgrading the smaller internal packages -  `pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography`

    Step B0 - upgrading the Astro to the latest, `pnpm dlx @astrojs/upgrade`
    Step B1 - testing the upgrades so far, then running a `pnpm astro check` to see if there are any issues with the current code base.
    Step B2 - Wait, we can not just run that command, we would have make sure that the `project.json` has a check for each project that Astro is inside of.
    Step B2.1 - Looks like we have some typescript errors and a couple failures with the development build, lets move towards a new step to focus on resolving those issues.

    Step C0 - We need to migrate the tailwindcss configurations for v3 to v4, including updating the tailwindcss pipeline.
    Step C1 - The postcss changed with v4, so let me install that next `pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/postcss`, then update the `global.css`.
    Step C2 - Looping back around, there was a breaking change in starlight, so I will make that adjustment as well.
    Step C3 - Running the `pnpm nx reset` , clearning out the cache and maybe we need to clear up some of the cache and modules, to avoid possible issues.

## 2024


### Python

Today is going to be a heavy day of sneeks.
The big phat python that hopefully will not wrap around my server or neck.

Earlier, I went ahead and updated a decent amount of the `atlas` code base, preparing it for the future production environment, including test casing it on docker.

Yet, sadly, even the weird edge cases become a huge pain! But its been long over due, at least since last year, so it makes sense that I invest some heavy time into it.


### FastAPI

To get started, we will add both the `fastapi` and the `uvicorn[standard]` to our standard poetry book, as they will provide the main entrance to our software stack.
Majority of the codebase will be within the `kbve_atlas`, with a `main.py` file located outside of it.
This `main.py` file will be the router that we use to handle all the python routes, including any micro-service that we might need down the line.
Under the current build, I am thinking of keeping a bunch of the services within an isolated python instance and then using our Rust API to handle the communication between them, ideally using a queue style system.


### Main.py

Now the adventure of integrating the `main.py` with the FastAPI.

Here are the core functions we are going to migrate!

The first is the google/rss news feed:

```python
async def google_main():
    #rss_url = "https://news.google.com/rss?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
    rss_url = "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml"
    rss_utility = RSSUtility(base_url=rss_url)

    try:

        soup = await rss_utility.fetch_and_parse_rss()
        rss_feed_model = await rss_utility.convert_to_model(soup)
        formatted_feed = RSSUtility.format_rss_feed(rss_feed_model)
        print(formatted_feed)
    finally:
        print("Done RSS")

    pass
```

While doing that change, I realized we could decor the poetry_main and coindesk_main.

```python

async def poetry_main():
    poetry_client = PoetryDBClient()
    try:
        random_poem = await poetry_client.get_random_poem()
        print(f"Title: {random_poem.title}\nAuthor: {random_poem.author}\n")
        print("\n".join(random_poem.lines))
        await poetry_client.close()
        print("\n Closed Session")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

        pass

async def coindesk_main():
    coindesk_client = CoinDeskClient()
    try:
        bitcoin_price = await coindesk_client.get_current_bitcoin_price()
        print(bitcoin_price)
    finally:
        await coindesk_client.close()

        pass


```

Added a decorant / base wrapper around the get command to make the movement of services faster and easier.

The decorants can be extended out, which will be within the `util` folder of atlas, but for now we should have more than enough to execute what we would need.

Next, we can add the broadcasting for `ATLAS`, holding our chat and the a couple of the basic or general machine learning commands.

To add the broadcasting, we will first add the library that was recommended by the FastAPI Team.
Shell Command: `./kbve.sh -nx atlas:add --name=broadcaster[redis]`

One of the things that I just realized is that we will need an internal Redis server, ideally one that can be accessed by Rust, Python, n8n, ect...

Hmm, creating a redis cluster within the swarm does make the most sense, with a redis entity on each node within the whole swarm?

We could also try to setup a redis bridge that would let some of the microservices sub/pub data from? This might just be all food for thought, I still need to do some more test casing.

Going to take a bit of a break from FastAPI and prepare to setup the broadcaster, we could also setup the relay through it as well! Hmmm....


### NX

The Nx flag on the `./kbve.sh` aka `-nx` seems to be only taking one arguement and none of the additional flags.

This is going to be a quick fix around it, just quickly update the shell file so that it can take multiple additional flags and keeping the older part of the shell code within the file.

After a week or so, I will go back and update the code.


### Broadcaster

The next goal for the day will be to setup a Pub/Sub for our C A R P stack! Oh the joys!

To start the broadcaster, we can use this code block:

```python

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    await broadcast.connect()


@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    await broadcast.disconnect()

```

Yet the issue is that `on_event` of `startup`/`shutdown` has become deprecated and instead we would have to use `@asynccontextmanager` and the `lifespan` decorated.

So lets update the code to look something like this:

```python

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    await broadcast.connect()
    yield
    await broadcast.disconnect()

```

To launch the current `ATLAS` , we will be using `uvicorn main:app --port 8086` however we might not have access to the redis right now on the mac, so lets swap that out to memory. 

Here is the quick swap to memory:

```python

broadcast = Broadcast("memory://")

```
