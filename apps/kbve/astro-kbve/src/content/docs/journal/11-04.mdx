### Deadlock got my mind going crazy.

-	01:25PM

	Solved my first major bug with the godot and rust bridge!
	This was a deadlock that was a pain to find because the error was not in the output!
	It turns out that my buffers were just way too small and that we needed to update them to work with the amount of data that was being processed.
	Next I need to figure out the best way to handle websockets.

-	1:41PM

	Ergo supports websockets by default, so that means I could just update the kubernetes to use them.
	There are two sides to this, one will be getting the internal nginx to work within the current ergo eco-system.
	Finally the other side might be to make our own reverse proxy for the IRC.

    **Supabase**

	There are two points to the supabase, the first one we will be tackling the onboarding function.
	The goal would be to move the process of registering into an isolated scope within the onboarding.
	This way we can make a function that only logged in users can call and it would check if the username is unique but also allows us to rate control the call.
	In the previous way that we were handling it, the username query could have been abused and instead of working around fixing that, it would make more sense to disable guests or anons from using the function.
	By moving more of the future logic into an authenticated role, we can build a better system for controlling the permissions and rate controls.
	So if the user is making too many queries, we can issue a warning and/or a ban.
	Furthermore, we will extend out the kilobase image to include a fail2ban at the container level.

	Hmm, okay so we would tackle the username issue first, then switch over to updating the user card next.
	I create a new sql file called 20241104120000_remove_username_for_auth.sql and that will be what we run to adjust our username function.
	We want this to be only for a situation of giving the username out during the onboarding process, hopefully not updating an exisiting username.

	Ah, to be safe, I will also include this:

	```sql

	-- Check if _user_id is NULL (i.e., the caller is not authenticated)
    IF _user_id IS NULL THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'not_authenticated';
    END IF;

	```

	Even if the `auth.id()` is not providing a valid UUID, I want to make sure the function gracefully fails if the `_user_id` is null.

	**HouseOfMemes**

	This season of house of memes is about to be over and I am just waiting for the crazy plot twists to occur!
	Will it be a poll attack? 
	Another massive riot breaking out in NYC?
	There are so many questions and I would be on full alert if I was near any voting booth.

-	06:24PM

	**UserCards**

	Moving forward with the next Supabase adjustment, we have to make minor changes to how we handle the usercards.
	The first being the situation where they get their initial card, hmmmm, I believe it will be during the onboarding phase and we can place null spots into the table.
	However, like the bio, we might have to split the fields of the usercard into a couple different subsections?
	I am still trying my best to figure out the way to handle the json verification for this, which I am going to assume will be just a series of guess and checks until it works.

	```sql

	BEGIN;
	--  Drop older trigger and function
	DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_new_card_created ON auth.users;
	DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_user_card_update();
	COMMIT;

	```

	These two functions will remove the trigger on the `auth.users` and drop the function to `handle_user_card_update()`.
	Similar to how we were handling the `user_profiles` earlier.

	**DB**

	The database will be split amoung three core areas that we will focus on, the tables under public, the triggers and finally the functions.
	These will be the point of focus of this week, after we establish a baseline of operating the functions within expo too.
	We know that registering and login work fine, but there was some issues with upodating the bio that need to be resolved.
	The problem we made with that function was that it was not too specific and that needs to be addressed during the user card process.
