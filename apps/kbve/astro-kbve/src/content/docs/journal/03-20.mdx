## Notes


## 2025

### Severance S1

-   08:22PM

    While working on the gRPC protocol from yesterday, I decided to take a quick break and finally watch the first season of the show.
    Lumon already has that crazy thriller vibe, even the first episode is starting off strong.


-   08:55PM

    It makes sense why this show is so popular, I might end up binge watching the whole first season in the next day or two.
    I bet this will do wonders for the neruolink project too.
    That got me thinking about what work will be like in a hundred years from now, with the rate of A.I growth, it will be wild.

### gRPC Status

-   08:29PM

    The Status concept was something that Fudster was suggesting as an application for creating an ai twitter like system.
    My idea would be to use that concept but integrate it into the Discordsh as a prototype, basically a proof of concept, maybe even an integration to discord itself.
    By leveraging the discord servers, we have a place to store the data but also have the ability to expand a server out with unique features.
    The best example of this would be Midjourney and how they integrated their AI Image generation with Discord, we would be doing the same but merging the status-like application with Discord.
    Once more this would offload a bunch of the burdens that we would face, like having to store memes and also having to look for users, since Discord has a large eco-system.
    Finally, all of these integrations will be built around tooling that can then be re-purposed for anything else in the future.

## 2024


### Enable3D

The actual location for the example source [code / repo](https://github.com/enable3d/enable3d-website/tree/master/src/examples)

The first two commands we ran this morning were: 

- `./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:dev` - Astro on port 4321
- `./kbve.sh -nx react-phaser-three:serve` - Vite on port 4200

We will begin by looking through the examples of the `PhysicsLoader` and the options that we have.

To grab the `ammo` libraries, we will just download the whole repo as a zip , aka `enable3d/enable3d-website` as a `master.zip`.
After downloading the zip, we will add the `/src/lib/ammo/` folders, located [here](https://github.com/enable3d/enable3d-website/tree/master/src/lib/ammo), into the vite public of `react-phaser-three`!

Actually, it might make more sense to upload the `ammo` files directly to `/apps/kbve.com/public/embed/js/ammo/` and have them hosted there.
Yet for the time being, we will place them inside of the vite.

So we have placed them into two locations. 

Location 1 - `/apps/kbve.com/public/embed/js/ammo/`
Location 2 - `/apps/react-phaser-three/public/ammo/`

During the development phase, we will just call it from the relative path and then once we are ready, we can call it from an absolute path.

After that , we need to add a Location 3 , which would be a CDN, Content Delivery Network, and a Location 4 , which would be the Discord Reverse Proxy.

Location 1 - `/apps/kbve.com/public/embed/js/ammo/`
Location 2 - `/apps/react-phaser-three/public/ammo/`
Location 3 - TODO CDN
Location 4 - Discord Reverse Proxy

Now to call the `ammo` library, we can take a look at the specific ammo examples from the `enable3d-website`, here is a reference to the [search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aenable3d%2Fenable3d-website%20ammo&type=code)

The current error that we are facing is a double canvas, which might be similar to this [stackoverflow problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73910900/why-are-multiple-canvases-being-made-in-my-phaser-react-app)

Currently we have three canvas:

```html

<canvas id="enable3d-phaser-canvas">
<canvas data-engine="three.js r161" id="enable3d-three-canvas">
<canvas id="enable3d-phaser-canvas">

```

Here are our attempts to resolve the multiple canvas problem, we are adding these here for reference.


```javascript

      //const game = new Phaser.Game(gameConfig); 

      //enable3d(() => new Phaser.Game(config)).withPhysics('assets/ammo')
      //enable3d(() => game).withPhysics('assets/ammo')
      //enable3d(() =>  game);

      // 03-20-2024 - 7:21am Attempt to Load Ammo Physics Engine 
      // enable3d(() => new Phaser.Game(gameConfig)).withPhysics('/ammo/kripken')

      // try to handle with a game instance
      // enable3d(() => {
      //   const game = new Phaser.Game({...config, parent: gameRef.current});
      //   gameInstance.current = game;
      //   return gameInstance.current;
      // }).withPhysics('/ammo/kripken')



      // return () => {
      //   // Cleanup the game when the component is unmounted
      //   // game.destroy(true);
      //   if (gameInstance.current) {
      //     gameInstance.current.destroy(true);
      //     gameInstance.current = null;
      //   }
      // };

```

We believe it might be because we have multiple physics, with ammo and arcade, so we will remove the default physics.

```javascript

    physics: {
          default: 'arcade',
          arcade: {
            gravity: { x: 0, y: 0 },
            debug: false,
            worldBounds: true,
            emitOnWorldBounds: true
          }
        },

```

It ended up being that we were using two `useRef` and instead we had to use the `state` and two `useEffect` to handle the loading for the multiple canvas problem.

Now that we have the canvas loaded and ready, we can move forward with different types of demos with that Ammo physics engine.

### Express

The base application for colyseus is express, so let us set that up!

We will run this command to init the application, `pnpm nx g @nx/node:application express-colyseus-discord`

Afterwards, we will run: `pnpm nx show project express-colyseus-discord --web` , which will give us a breakdown of the commands.

Finally we have the serve command, which is `pnpm nx run express-colyseus-discord:serve`, we can use this as `./kbve.sh -nx express-colyseus-discord:serve`

We got port 3000 running and it says hello!

Okay! It seems that we missed a couple libraries. 

`pnpm install uwebsockets-express`.

After we get the base of colyseus up and running, we will go ahead and ship this out!

Next we will make sure the docker build works for the application, inside of a Node instance.

We change the output to be within the same folder `"outputPath": "apps/express-colyseus-discord/dist",` via the `project.json`.

Wait! I will revert that for now because of the build path that we have setup with the rust deployment. 

The goal would be to release the initial dockerfile and then loop back around with another instance to chisel the that instance.

We should also have an internal version number to keep track of the dockerbuilds during the deployment.

The two builds are located here:

- `/apps/express-colyseus-discord`
- `/migrations/docker/chisel/colyseus-discord/Dockerfile`

After the build is sucessful, we will do the two docker builds, one after the other.
Then we can do the automatic deployment via the shell command.

While we are preparing the Docker system for the Colyseus, I want to take a moment, to look over the tutorial for integrating both of them!

- [Colyseus Phaser Tutorial](https://learn.colyseus.io/phaser/1-basic-player-movement) - 4 Part Guide on how to set it up and execute all the scenes within.


### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile will be similar to the other ones that we have built in the past, our goal would be to just get a generic build out of the way.

The first build comes in at around 300MB but it seems to be functional, with the node application running on port 3000.

Going to sync this into the main branch and then build out a docker compose.

As for the `chisel` build, we would have to use esbuild, rspack or vite to combine all of the node modules into a single js esm file and then run that in a sliced ubuntu container.
Of which, I do not want to do, until maybe next week.

Now that I am thinking about it, the `outdir` would be an issue for the `dist`? I am going to run it up production and see if there are any issues with the pipeline cycle.`
