## Notes

## 2025

-   12:30PM

    **Hardcore**

    I did not get a chance to write the story of yesterday or well this mornings hardcore event, it was way too wild.
    Next round, I am going to keep it a bit more chill and slow, moving too fast is part of the problem.
    Treat it more like a RTS than a MMO, is the best way that I can describe the hardcore flow!

    **EoY**

    The End of the Year reports as well as Q4s are going to be rough if the trade deals move forward.
    Hmm, I can get furthere down into the notes for that on a different page, but once the tariffs kicks.
    
-   04:24PM

    **Python**

    Updating the python package for nx, to `20.3.1` via `pnpm add @nxlv/python@20.3.1`.
    This upgrade could break somethings, but just want to make sure it all works.

## 2024

- 6:05am - Getting ready for work and double checking my accounts for 2024!
    I need to adjust my morning gym routine, I might have to get up earlier.

- 12:45pm - Finished up with work and going to focus on KBVE monorepo.

- 2:20pm - Preparing a test case of the embed widget and see how it will work within our astro framework.
    Adding the `react-helmet-async` for calling some of the abstract scripts, like hcaptcha.
    Under the `main.tsx`, we will import the helmet provider and then wrap our `App` element inside of it.
        ```js

        import { HelmetProvider } from 'react-helmet-async';

            root.render(
            <StrictMode>
                <HelmetProvider>
                    <App />
                </HelmetProvider>
            </StrictMode>
        );
        ```
    Afterwards we would call `<Helmet>` for the abstract scripts that we would need within certain states.
    For the `register` state, we would use it like this:

        ```js
        <Helmet>        
        <script src="https://js.hcaptcha.com/1/api.js?" async defer></script>
        </Helmet>
        ```

- 7:56pm - Finished onboarding `SoksoaCode` and we were able to get the `twin.macro` library up and running within the `js-embed-passport` application!
    The issue was just forgetting some basic generic javascript/typescript settings, including making sure vite and babel can play together.

- 11:40pm - Ending the night of DnD with some league, tomorrow is another da
