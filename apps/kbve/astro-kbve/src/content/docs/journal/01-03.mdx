## Notes

## 2026

### OSRS Item Page

-   11:15AM

    The item page is going through another revamp, I am currently trying to figure out the best way to handle the charts.
    Once we get the OSRS charts resolved and proper index + mapping for the items, we can expand this into the stocks.
    Having all the stock data, afterwards would be amazing but there is going to be some issues figuring it all out in the future.
    I believe we might have to lock down the API but for now we can keep it open.

    **Hardcore**

    I did not get a chance to write the story of yesterday or well this mornings hardcore event, it was way too wild.
    Next round, I am going to keep it a bit more chill and slow, moving too fast is part of the problem.
    Treat it more like a RTS than a MMO, is the best way that I can describe the hardcore flow!

    **EoY**

    The End of the Year reports as well as Q4s are going to be rough if the trade deals move forward.
    Hmm, I can get furthere down into the notes for that on a different page, but once the tariffs kicks.

    **Python**

    Updating the python package for nx, to `20.3.1` via `pnpm add @nxlv/python@20.3.1`.
    This upgrade could break somethings, but just want to make sure it all works.

## 2024

- 6:05am - Getting ready for work and double checking my accounts for 2024!
    I need to adjust my morning gym routine, I might have to get up earlier.

- 12:45pm - Finished up with work and going to focus on KBVE monorepo.

- 2:20pm - Preparing a test case of the embed widget and see how it will work within our astro framework.
    Adding the `react-helmet-async` for calling some of the abstract scripts, like hcaptcha.
    Under the `main.tsx`, we will import the helmet provider and then wrap our `App` element inside of it.
        ```js

        import { HelmetProvider } from 'react-helmet-async';

            root.render(
            <StrictMode>
                <HelmetProvider>
                    <App />
                </HelmetProvider>
            </StrictMode>
        );
        ```
    Afterwards we would call `<Helmet>` for the abstract scripts that we would need within certain states.
    For the `register` state, we would use it like this:

        ```js
        <Helmet>        
        <script src="https://js.hcaptcha.com/1/api.js?" async defer></script>
        </Helmet>
        ```

- 7:56pm - Finished onboarding `SoksoaCode` and we were able to get the `twin.macro` library up and running within the `js-embed-passport` application!
    The issue was just forgetting some basic generic javascript/typescript settings, including making sure vite and babel can play together.

- 11:40pm - Ending the night of DnD with some league, tomorrow is another da
