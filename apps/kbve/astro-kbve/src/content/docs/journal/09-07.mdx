## 2024

**Brew**

I am going to quickly re-install brew onto my linux setup, then utilize brew as a common manager amoung my debian, wsl and mac instances.
Just for my future self, I added a quick install script for brew into the repo, which we can use incase brew is missing.
Maybe we could add these barebone scripts in a future devops release, so that it be easier to manage new instances, hmm, I will table that one for now.

**CitySkyLine**

Made a quick city through the game, its actually pretty fun and interesting but there is a lack of content for mid or late game.
I think its because the game is still new and we will have to wait for the expansions and mods.

**CloudNative**

There are some plugins that we still need to test case for deployment of the HA clusters.
The main issue is testing the recovery and the backup, but the s3 configuration still needs to be done before hand.

## 2023
- 7:07am - Watching Ziggy's amazing stream, its perfect!
- 7:57am - Getting ready to write different types of test casing across the board for work and my personal websites.
- 1:03pm - Decided to go with a basic three tab setup as an Index card. I am thinking of isolating it towards three areas, the first being the blog, second being services and finally the third being an about section. I might have some additional widgets built into it. As for after the index card, I might look at adding custom tailwindcss animation, which I need a bit more practice with.
- 1:51pm - Let me commit this current checkpoint and then check back with the team on their k3s instance, maybe sneak in a quick league match too.
- 2:01pm -
