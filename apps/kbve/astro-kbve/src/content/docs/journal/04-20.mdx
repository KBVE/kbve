## 2025

### WebWorkers

-   12:05PM

    There are a decent amount of issues with the front-end and I think it might be time to call in for some help.
    My idea would be to either contract it all out or buy an existing out-sourcing company?
    Building an out-sourcing company would make sense for the long term because we could give those developers internal work but I do not want to handle it all.
    Thus a semi-ownership / partnership would be the best way to go about it?

## 2024

**Blaze**

As part of the traditions, it might be wise to partake in a quick sesh.



**Docker**

I should update the docker lists on the monorepo, so that it be easier to find the images.
For now I will add the [Express Colyseus Discord](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbve/expresscolyseusdiscord) and then once v01d gets built and RelationTableAliasProxyHandler, I will add that as well.


**CICD**

Going to disable the outpost report generator for now because it seems to be causing an error by adding back a broken locked pnpm.
Under the CICD pipeline, we went ahead and added sha hashes to each of the automatic patches that the `ci-main` produces!
I will also go ahead and do the same with `beta` and `alpha` within the next couple weeks, slowly integrating these changes throughout the pipeline.


**Fallout**

We are about to watch the whole `fallout` tv series, from start to finish!
I am actually super excited to see the whole thing, I heard it was great.



**Fooocus**

I am thinking that the best way for us to use `fooocus` would be to start with their docker image as a base, then add our atlas into that base image?
There is still some planning that we need to do before adding that in, hmm, I am going to draw it out and then see what steps that I need to make to get it done.



## 2023


**India**

- I spent most of the day running around the main city, looking for new clothes, belts and shawls!
- Starship ... well update. it went rip.

## 2018

An entry from 2018 was found but I need to make sure that I can read through it all before I write it up into a new journal.
I am keeping this here to remind myself to arrange a future myself to be a bit more responsible.
I will gohead and update the names that are on the list or older journal because they do not need to be linked unless they are a reader ofthis joural , community meme=bmer or just straight staklking lol
