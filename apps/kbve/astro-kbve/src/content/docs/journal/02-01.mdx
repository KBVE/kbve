## Notes


## 2025

-   **Feb**

    08:10AM

        The morning has started and I am super excited to get into the flow!

    10:19AM

        After making some breakfast and getting my rogue leveled up, I am going to switch over to some godot development.
        It is time for me to being testing some of the new UI library changes that I been making.

### 2024

    -   8:00am -   `Tub`

        #### Tub

            I have to figure out a way to remove the old tub from the bathroom and its going to be a pain.
            Besides it being super heavy, almost moldy and broken, it needs to go into a recylcing dump asap.
            Ah, I think there is a solution for removing the tub, hmm...
               

    -   2:30pm  -   `Jedi`

        #### Jedi
        
            Time to integrate the jedi crate into the KBVE package!
            My written notes are a bit out of sync with my mdx notes, so I need to go back and fix that as well.
