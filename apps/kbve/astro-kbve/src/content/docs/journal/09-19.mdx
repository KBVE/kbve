## 2024

**beau is afraid**

Just spent the midnight watching this amazing piece of comedy & horror film!
It was 3 hours long but it was twisted, funny and wild, I would recommend going into it but with a bunch of people.
I think its a bit rough to watch alone, its definitely better with a couple other people over a discord call.
An IRL Jojo adventures.

**Fleet**

Okay we did the first phase of the fleet deployment and we were able to get the charts automatically loaded.
Granted it failed to deploy a decent amount of the services but that is fine because we did not include any of the secrets and thus, a decent amount of the services failed.
The `armada` could be another part of the deployment that can help us with the secret management, using the sealed secret concept but I am thinking that the vault might be enough for what we want to do.

**CICD**

While we are doing the fleet ops, we also need to create the custom kilobase image that we have to add into our fleet.
This part of the build process will be a bit annoying because we need to make sure that the requirements for building the custom postgres extension has to be done outside of the docker build.
On the debate of how we should handle the extension building process, I felt that it would make more sense to have it all built outside of the docker image and then just copy the extension over.
The other path was to build the extension within the docker image itself, which we can do if this outside-the-docker image build process becomes too much of a pain.

For the first part of the CICD workflow, we created a custom job called `kilobase_dev_cicd` and we know that this will fail in a couple spots.
The goal for this would be to get the base image published as a `kilobase-dev` before we go out of our way to build the main image!
I am not too sure how the tag system will work in this case because I believe we will have to update the project.json to include all three, `local`, `dev` and `production`.

The CICD failed this time around because I placed `postgresql-server-dev-15` and it should have been `postgresql-server-dev-all`, but I am wondering if I need to also include something else for this part.

**Kilobase**

The extension has three core errors within the query for the background worker.
A couple of the errors is just a type mismatch and I can adjust them as I am working through the changes in the workflow, but damn paraops is rough on the mental state.
Keeping track of all the changes in the eco-system and placing all the puzzle pieces together at the same time they are being printed out of a machine.
Spent way too many hours going through the possible ways of resolving the background worker, the only solution that I could come up with was to migrate all the code into the worker.
I would have enjoyed having some level of isolation within the fuctions but there just was way too many type issues and I rather keep things simple for now.

The adventure of getting the container running, I might just switch to tomorrows entry for this.
