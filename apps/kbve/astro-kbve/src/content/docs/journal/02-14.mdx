## Notes

## 2025

### Dat Nightly Flow

-   01:06AM

    New day, new memes!
    Time to see how we go about grabbing that data from the user settings and rendering it.


### Markets

-   04:04PM

    Good to see Nvdia go up towards the $140 mark, I am hoping that it crosses back into the $150 after the earnings.

### Godot GUIy

-   04:21PM

    GUI Management has this painful peroid, where everything just looks terrible at first.
    Getting the shader to work right, then all of the position issues, ugh, makes me miss tailwind and tamagui way too much.

### GameJam 2025.1

-   04:41PM

    The topic for the Brackeys 13 aka 2025.1 gamejam was announced!
    It seems to be `ERASE` with a couple wild cards, `MIMIC`, `STYLE SHIFT`, and `SHOPAHOLIC`.
    Let me update the notes for the game to reflect that.

## 2024

#### Toon

Round 2! Fight!

I am going to try and see if I can get the official unity toon shader to load up and maybe attempt to integrate it into this game project!

The goal would be to get a comical style within the game objects and the environment, but we shall see how it goes!

Okay we were able to get the basics of the cell shader to be functional, granted there is an experimental packages warning that appears.

Here is the official repo for the toonshader that we are using, aka Unity Chan, https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.toonshader

I will push through these changes, then mess around with the sample scenes.

Okay it looks like we can disable the Itch build for now because it will keep failing, since we need to figure out how to load abstract assets.

So for now, the best step would be to setup the unity build condition, which I will place inside of the `ci-alpha`.

Here is `setup` configuration under the `ci-alpha.yml`,

```yaml

        setup:
            name: "Setup"
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            outputs:
              build_unity: ${{ steps.set_output.outputs.build_unity }}
            steps:
              - id: set_output
                run: "::set-output name=build_unity::false"

```

Then I will extend the condition for the saber build, `if: needs.alter.outputs.saber == 'true' && needs.setup.outputs.build_unity == 'true'`, which will help prevent the build fails that we will be facing.
