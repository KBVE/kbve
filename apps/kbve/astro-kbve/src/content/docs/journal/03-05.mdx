## Notes

## 2025

### Market

-   10:23AM

    TaR-Rifts are at it again, not resolving any of the issues and just making it more painful for everyone involved.
    However, it be interesting to see where the money goes from these tariffs and if we are going to place more of them on other nations.

### Bevy ECS

-   09:35PM

    Pushed the last bit of code up but realized that I am handling the player node in the wrong way.
    We would have to dynamically adjust the sprite and character colliders, furthermore we would have to adjust the layering for the character.
    All of these need to be handled during the gd script / singleton setup, ugh, back to the drawing board I go.

## 2024

### Bento

Getting the core demo of the bento grid as a template to render within the website.
This took way too much time to resolve, I believe the amount of nested components / files made the process of debugging a bit painful.

We were able to get the general bento grid to render, which is a win for us, but we still need to get the basic react children nodes to render.

I am currently in the process of adding the `html-react-parser` and this should help us in both this bento grid and in Phaser.

The build process looks like it is working, but it seems that I am still having some issues with the `html-react-parser`!
Let me try a different approach because this seems to be a bit broken and I am not feeling it.



### React

Github [Issue Ticket - #880](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/880)

The reference is probably the most important part of the example, this should make it easier to extend out the components within Phaser.


### FishChip

Chippy fixed the displayCombo aspect for the mini gamejam!

I also help chip get onboarded for the whole monorepo, which is another huge win!

We can now expand and build more abstract applications without having to switch around in multiple repos.


## Tasks

- [ ] Finish Bento Grid
- [ ] Phaser React Integration
