## Notes

## Tasks

[ ] - Prepare Discord Jam R&D
[ ] - Travel Jam Repo

## 2025

### Solana Soul

-   12:14AM

    Focus will be in two parts, the first is the generic module layout and basic modules for a demo application.
    Before building the main application, the demo would be like a quick precursor to the main application.

-   01:19AM

    Okay, for this crate and future application, we would place the focus on `error.rs` and build it around `thiserror` crate.
    We should also look into the logging crate but that can be next, hmm.

### Github Tj Action

-   05:29PM

    Looks like the tj-action file changes was compromised and there needs to be a drop-in replacement for the action.
    After replacing the action, I will go through all our tokens and replace them all with new ones, i.e token and secret rotation.
    I do not think there was much of a security risk but it would make sense to be safe.

### GA Matrix Round 1

-   10:38PM

    Usually I been using other people's matrixes for github actions, but I think it is time to build my own!
    The last time I wrote one was for the unity builds but now I am going to try it for the publishing of the crates, npm and pip packages.

    Something like this below would be nice:

    ```yaml

    publish_crates:
        needs: ['deploy', 'alter', 'globals']
        name: Publish Crates
        strategy:
            matrix:
            package:
                - { name: 'q', condition: needs.alter.outputs.q }
                - { name: 'jedi', condition: needs.alter.outputs.jedi }
        if: matrix.package.condition == 'true'
        uses: KBVE/kbve/.github/workflows/rust-publish-crate.yml@main
        with:
            package: ${{ matrix.package.name }}
        secrets:
            CRATES_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CRATES_TOKEN }}

    ```

    It would make sense that I save this information inside of the [git](https://kbve.com/application/git/) notes, so more information can be found there.
    Okay, we had to run two jobs, one that would filter through the matrix to see what needs to be built and then the second job would be the actual publishing.
    This can be later updated for the pip and npm packages too.

### Nx Graph

-   08:57PM

    Nx graph has a static output that runs under :

    ```bash
    pnpm nx graph --file=./apps/kbve/kbve.com/public/nx/index.html
    ```

    Which can be used to generate an additional nx embed, combined with the report.
    Report + Graph under the projects astro page would be a nice update for the site.
    I will make an issue ticket with that as a future update, definitely when I want to switch out of rust and do some astro or javascript.

## 2024

### Travel

Travel Game Jam!
We are thinking David Goliath or a boeing flappy bird style game, hmmm.

Bell just reminded me of the `Mighty Max` concept and maybe we could use that as a base concept for the game?

There are only 69 hours left in the jam, we got this!

The repo for the last mini game was under `nextjs-react-fish-chip-built-request` , now we could go ahead and create a new one.

Okay! The demo for the pipeline looks perfect, so time to test case this with the `travelbox` gamejam.

We will have to create a new react app with the vite bundler!

Run : `pnpm nx g @nx/react:app react-phaser-travelbox --bundler=vite`

Then we would update the `ci-beta` twith this code block.

```yaml

            #   [React] -> Travel Box

            -   name: React Travel Box
                if: needs.alter.outputs.reacttravelbox == 'true'
                uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                with:
                    flag: '-build react-phaser-travelbox'
                    create_pull_request: true
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                    pull_request_title: 'react-travelbox-built-request'
                    pull_request_body: 'React TravelBox Built Request'


```

Now the game build itself, mapping out the menu will be easy and we can at least start from there.
The configurations are next on the journy!

The first was the NX Project JSON for building out the application, which we can extend the `project.json` to help us handle it.

```json
    "build": {
			"executor": "@nx/vite:build",
			"outputs": ["{options.outputPath}"],
			"defaultConfiguration": "production",
			"options": {
				"outputPath": "apps/kbve.com/public/embed/js/travelbox",
				"emptyOutDir": true
			},
			"configurations": {
				"development": {
					"mode": "development"
				},
				"production": {
					"mode": "production"
				}
			}
		}
```

This way the game that gets built can go directly into the `travelbox` embed and we can work from there.

After setting up the build command within the nx project, `./kbve.sh -nx react-phaser-travelbox:build`, we can add our rollup configurtions too.

```js

      rollupOptions: {
        external: ['fs', 'path', 'process'],
        output: {
          // ES Module Output
          format: 'es', // ES module format
          // Change the output directory structure and naming
          entryFileNames: `travelbox.js`,
          chunkFileNames: `[name].js`,
          assetFileNames: `[name].[ext]`,
        },
      },

```

We will come back to this on a later date, probably need to adjust the configuration of the chunking, but it will get that initial file down.

Third step will be to make it so that we adjust the `travelbox/index.astro` to load the new travelbox build.

### TravelBox Menu

Getting started on the `TravelBox` Menu? This will be the menu of the game, while I am trying to remember the different parts of the menu haha.


### TravelBox GamePlay

The gameplay for the `travelbox` and the design around it will be a bit of a test casing for us.
