## Notes

## 2025

-   **Supabase**

    01:15PM

        The supabase integration with fastapi can be done in two ways, indirectly through the JWT or directly though a local connection to the supabase.
        Before making the local connection to the supabase, I am going to do the remote connection first!
        We just want to make sure that the user can login from the supabase instance.
        Actually we also need to add the ingress to have a local connection but for now we can use a `https://supabase.kbve.com` during the testing phase.
        In the future we want to use a `supabase.local` to handle it for us.

    05:20PM

        We were missing the PyJWT, so I am going to go ahead and add that into the repo.
        To do this, we will use this nx command:

```shell
 pnpm nx run pydiscordsh:add --name pyjwt
```

        This will add the library to our `pydiscordsh`.
    
    11:00PM

        There was a solid amount of progress being made this Friday!
        However I am going to switch the notes over to the next day.

## 2024

-   11:04am - `WorkFlow`

        #### Workflow

            Preparing a new document for table optimization!
            I am going to move away from adding large text chunks and focus more on visualizations, as it makes the reading a bit easier.
            Sometimes I feel like I am just writing 30 pages of non-sense that feels almost useless because of GPT, thus I think focusing more on the visual elements would be better for everyone.
            Furthermore, I wonder if I should include RAG embeds into the mixture, I suppose that will be the future of MDX in 2024!

-   3:00pm - `SoD`

        #### SoD

            Got off of work and jumping straight into Season of Discovery!
            I am currently leveling up a Night Elf Druid called BearBeer and its been a throw back, playing classic WoW is always a childhood throwback.
            Since i have a decent background in Ascension, this SoD concept seems like it is a great concept for Blizzard to expand upon.
            However, I think the leveling should be a bit slower, with limits on the speed of progression.
            I should also note the amount of bots is a bit insane.

-   5:30pm - `Rune`

        #### Rune

            While I am enjoying the flow of the game, looking for the runes is also a bit more interesting, I like how they are doing it for this gamemode.
            There could be some further improvements with how to handle the runes but so far they have been balanced.

-   7:40pm - `ERust`

        #### ERust

            The library needs a couple changes, I believe the best course of action would be to modularize the crate into sub-folders.
            This means I should also do the same for the `kbve` crate too.
            I might have to remove a bunch of the `widgets` that I have in place and refactor them, maybe split it into three groups:

                - `widgets`
                - `utility`
                - `state`

                These are the first three modules within the `erust` that I will focus on.
