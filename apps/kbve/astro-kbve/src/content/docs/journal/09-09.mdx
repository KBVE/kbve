## 2024

**Terraform Proxmox** 

Spent the majority of the day doing some test casing for terraform!
I am getting a bit better at handling the different edge cases and making sure the tfstate is able to execute in order.

**Shaco Skin**.
Oh boi, I finally have a reason to spend all those amazon x riot points.

**KillTony**

Excited for tonights kill tony!
We got a sam jay and greg combo, dope!

**KiloBase**
The next stage for deployment is to setup a cloudnative pg image based off of supabase, we will call this the kilobase.

**nxContainers**
Within the monorepo, we are going to add a new package into the nx eco-system that will help with building containers.
The nx containers still needs to be updated within the github actions and ci-cd pipeline.

## 2023

- 8:43am - Looking over the UI/UX components for the next game that we build, I am diving a bit deeper.
