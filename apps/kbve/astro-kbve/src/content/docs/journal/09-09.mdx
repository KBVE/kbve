### KBVE Hyperlane

-   09:53PM
    
    A huge moment within the KBVE website, we finally moved the website away from the Github pages and into an Astro/Rust deployment.
    I also believe that we might be one of the first to do so, the tests with Disoxide have been great and this is the perfect step towards the direction that we want.
    There are still some bugs that we need to resolve, but I will tackle them during the next refactor of the KBVE website.

## 2024

**Terraform Proxmox** 

Spent the majority of the day doing some test casing for terraform!
I am getting a bit better at handling the different edge cases and making sure the tfstate is able to execute in order.

**Shaco Skin**.
Oh boi, I finally have a reason to spend all those amazon x riot points.

**KillTony**

Excited for tonights kill tony!
We got a sam jay and greg combo, dope!

**KiloBase**
The next stage for deployment is to setup a cloudnative pg image based off of supabase, we will call this the kilobase.

**nxContainers**
Within the monorepo, we are going to add a new package into the nx eco-system that will help with building containers.
The nx containers still needs to be updated within the github actions and ci-cd pipeline.

## 2023

- 8:43am - Looking over the UI/UX components for the next game that we build, I am diving a bit deeper.
