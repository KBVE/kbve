### Birthdays

-   03:00PM

    Too many birthday parties! It feels like another June 1st xD
    Okay, now that I am home and zoned in, I am going to finish up the redis pipeline.

### Jedi Redis Pipeline

-   03:34PM

    The pipeline will be as modular as possible with the goal of creating a lego block style for coding.
    Yet there might be an issue with async because some modules might not play too well with the abstracted lifetimes, i.e communicating with an external database.
    The current question is how would we go about handling the connection_id situation, the first step could be just doing a simple arc string and encompassing it all as a request struct.
    Yet that ended up leading us down a terrible path where we just created too much bloat and abstraction structs.
    This time around, I will try to avoid that problem and find some logical solutions to each of these issues that arrive.
    First one that we are coming across is the meta data layer and how to keep that in the flow.
    Updating the proto file to include a 5th field, that will be `bytes` and holding the meta data.


## 2024

Time to build out the dashboard on `/dashboard` route!

## 2023

- 10:00am - Going to prepare myself to visit a local temple, which includes climbing a kilometer flight of stairs. The workout and stress from all that walking is definitely going to be terrible! However the views are going to be amazing and can not wait to be in the sky.
- 5:00pm - That was an intense trip, my feet are sore as hell. I am going to take a short rest and fix up some of the codebase, eat a small meal and get some rest.
