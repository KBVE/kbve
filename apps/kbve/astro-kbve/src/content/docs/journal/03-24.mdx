## Notes

## 2025

### Wow HC

-   02:40AM

    First time in a while that I saw the population dip almost near `low`, back to `medium` right now but the onlyfangs leaving might have an impact.
    The more that I play, the more that I want to make a modded version of wow that mixes in the dark and darker gameplay.
    I am very tempted to set it up but ugh, the amount of time and resources to do it.

### Redis WS

-   03:08AM

    RESP3 websockets are next! Since we already have the websockets handler setup, this part should be easy.
    Okay there is a valid connection from our websockets and the redis, also this means we could link it to discord and twitch too.
    Now we are getting to the fun and exciting parts, oh yes!

### Redis Proto

-   04:02AM

    Adding the websocket protobufs to the jedi crate.

-   06:32PM

    The redis websockets are still somewhat of an issue, in the sense that they can process the watch but are not being updated.
    I believe there might be a bit of a logical error on my end, so I might have to loop back around and see what went wrong.
    There is an option to drop back down to RESP2 and use the code below:

    ```rust
    
    use futures_util::StreamExt;
    let client = redis::Client::open("redis://redis/")?;
    let (mut sink, mut stream) = client.get_async_pubsub().await?.split();
    sink.subscribe("channel_1").await?;

    loop {
        let msg = stream.next().await.unwrap();
        let payload : String = msg.get_payload().unwrap();
        println!("channel '{}': {}", msg.get_channel_name(), payload);
    }

    ```

    This code was from the redis crate docs.

-   09:54PM

    The issue might be in our `spawn_pubsub_listner`, which might not be setup the right way.
    Why can we 


## 2024

### Actions

We will have the actions build the changes for the `expo-lcagents` and then push the changes to the new `KBVE/lc-agents.com` repo.

After pushing the code, we will use the main branch to execute any changes and have those get deployed?

Maybe we might not need to use the main branch, but we shall see.


### Bathroom

We were able to get the upstairs bathroom almost all fixed up!
The only thing missing is repairing the shower tiles but that will be for next month!


### HellDivers

Finally got enough credits to pickup a war bond!
I am a big fan of the laser weapons, mainly because we do not have to worry about the ammo.
My play style is a bit weak, which might be because I like to keep distance and only attack monsters when they are dangerous.
