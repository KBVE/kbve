## 2024

**Weekend**

The weekend flow is always a nice change of pace, I wonder what we can build this end of the month jam session.
We should host or plan another session with a bunch of devs, maybe try to pump a product out in 48 hours?

**Windows**

I am currently on the beef machine, aka vm 400, and the whole windows migration was a great success besides the WSL backups.
It seems that the encryption or maybe the way I setup the drives caused some issues when boating it up.
However, I think running a windows in an emulation environment then having ubuntu run under that is a bit overkill.
The current solution is to just have promxox deploy another ubuntu container and we run a ssh tunnel.
With that being said, I am also connecting the ssh tunnel with the mac book too, making it easier to build x86 without burning through the battery life of the laptop.

**HerbMail**

The next stage in the herb mail will be after we get a couple more LLM examples built out and tested.
Afterwards we want to run the mailserver using stalwart, a rust based scalable all-in-one server.
While I am moving forward with the LLM models, I think it would be wise to test case the deployment of stalwart.


## 2023
- 12:30pm - Looks like the Indian office approved my grandpa's visa extension! This is great news as it means I can plan my new trip to India a bit better and not have to worry about him being in India with an expired visa. This makes me wonder how my life will be when I am nearly at his age of 80? He is a true warrior, the man has done it all. 
- 3:30pm - I need to start planning the construct and layout for RareIcon, with all these projects in the backlog, I may have to find a better way to manage my time within the scope of error handling? I should utilize more of the error / issues that we have and then target them each over time.  I will postpone anything major for RareIcon until we get RJ onto the Steam store.
- 9:00pm - Finished organizing the notes and learned a bit more on how to use Mermaid! Moving forward, I will try to use mermaid for all our note taking, as it does make things a bit easier. 
- 9:30pm - Region Save for Dwarf Fortress. I wonder if I could make a repo for the game and then have that saved for people to access and play.
