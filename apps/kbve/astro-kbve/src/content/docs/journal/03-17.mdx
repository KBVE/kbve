## Notes

## 2025

### File Alters

-   01:09AM

    Still a bunch of issues with the workflow but we will be able to resolve them soon.
    The pipeline takes a while to rebuild, each time we have to shift the changes.

### n8n helm chart

-   01:17AM

    Helm chart for the n8n has been ready for v1, which we need to do the migration for, thus I should create a ticket for it.
    Reference for the chart is [here](https://github.com/8gears/n8n-helm-chart).

### Branch Retirement

-   01:45PM

    With the latest changes, it might be time to retire the alpha and beta branches and stick with just `main` and `dev` again.
    We can scale back the abstraction with the branches because we can use gitlab and azure to handle our alpha / beta.
    This would make things easier to build around and maintain while making the developement cycle easier to manage.

    The removed branches will be `alpha`, `beta` and `patch` workflows.

## 2024

### Jam

The jam is coming to an end and I want to thank everyone for helping out with the Travel Game Jam!
This journal entry is a bit short because I did not get a chance to go through and convert all my notes.
The biggest plan is now to prepare for the Discord App Jam!


### TypeSafety

Okay! I understand the pain of having strict typesafety during a Game Jam but if I can find a way to help migrate that pain from the start, I think we can speed up developement even faster.

My only other take away would be to push changes during the jam faster, keeping the cylce of CI/CD as continuous as possible.
There might be some areas of tooling that I would want to look into, including automatic merging.
