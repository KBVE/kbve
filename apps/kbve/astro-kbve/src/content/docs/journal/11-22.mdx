    **Rust**

    With the Friday deadline coming up, it would be best to quickly rush the discord build.
    Okay spent the whole night going through the different stages but we are getting somewhere with the game server docker container.

    **MMExtensions**

    The next step would be to add the MM Extensions as an unity project.
    Let me get this part rolling while I am working on the game server.
    The package will be the `mmextensions` and we will call them via `KBVE.MMExtensions`, as a reference to the more mountains extensions.

    **Unity Session**

    The session went great, we got a better understanding of using MM extensions, tried to do a tri-live-code session too.
    I believe that a couple more instances and we should have a faster flow of updates.
    Good work JigSaw and Silver, yall are great teachers.
