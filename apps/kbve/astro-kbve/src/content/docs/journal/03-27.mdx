## Notes

## 2025

### Druid

-   05:00AM

    Finally got my cat form and now I am doing the macros, ugh, means I need to loop back around and fix those.

### FlexBuffers

-   06:36PM

    Time to move from JSON over to Bytes!
    The journey has been a wild ride but having the experience now and the tools, should make this transition painless.
    Goal for now would be to move the binary data among different applications through the protobuf / jedi technique, following the footsteps of how Google does it.
    There could be some additional ways to handle this in 2025 but it would make sense to build around the exisiting tools, giving us the maintaince from larger organizations but just enough speed and performance.
    The vibe here is be a honda civic type flow, extremely fast but easy on the maintaince.
    A combination of a tesla model y and honda civic r, is the best way that I could summarize this experience.

## 2024


### iOS

I believe the plan for the day will be to get the iOS and the android builds as operational as we can.

To start we will first run the prebuild script, just to make sure that everything is good to go!

`./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:prebuild`

After making sure the prebuild script is fine, we can start to setup the iOS integration, using the pods and general native modules.

Next command to run will be the `./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:run-ios`, which will run the iOS simulator/emulator with the application inside of it.

I been debugging the whole `iOS` setup all day and its driving me crazy! I have to take breaks from debugging the code, by `de-bugging` the universe via helldiver.



### Root

It seems that I was doing the `index.js` the wrong way!
I am going to see if I can make it functional for the app as well, hmm maybe this bug is the reason why I was having the other bugs?
