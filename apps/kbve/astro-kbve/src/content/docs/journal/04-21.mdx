## 2025

### Svelte Panels

-   09:52AM

    Going to replace the alpine panels with that quad panel setup using svelte instead.
    The eventual goal would be to replace all the alpine plugins with pre-compiled svelte components, keeping the alpine for dynamic virtual DOM changes and future concepts.
    Basically design and build using the Alpine library, then if its worth keeping, we loop back around and turn it into a svelte component.

## 2024

I am thinking of updating the journal entry so that it becomes less deep nested.
It gets a bit annoying to nest in the different entries, I like the flexibility that comes with the mdx format.

**404**

The 404 Page has been updated!
It looks a bit better now compared to what we had before, tbh I might go back and desplit the `AstroVE` , as it made sense in the start but it seems to become a bit overkill.

**Astro**

Going to update the Astro to version 4.6.x and then update a bunch of NX plugins.
We will be migrating to the latest Nx aka 18.3.x and then upgrade Astro extension to the latest version.
However there are two plugins that we still need to update, the first being the python and then the rust, however I will do that after I update the website.

## 2023

**India**

-   I spent most of the day eating and relaxing.
-   The next phase will be setting up AppWrite register, login and profile.

## Notes

Cleaning up the default journal entry format within the mdx.

## Tasks

-   [ ] Homepage 2024 Update
