### Mana for CityVote

-   03:22PM

    Made a huge mistake, I forgot to include mana inside of the combat stats, so I will have to go through all of the game loop and include it.
    Every character should have mana, those that are melee can have a default special ability to turn mana into health?
    Wait that might be broken, let me think it through, regardless we need to add mana across the board for each of the characters.
    For the regeneration system, maybe we have them either create a campfire or have them visit a local city to help?

    For the two structure types, I am thinking that they will be City and Ruins, with the City being a form of top down RPG.
    While the ruins will be a platformer, this gives us a bit of both worlds, making the gameplay loop a bit more interesting while the turns are happening.
    The best way to have this occur would be by setting up the loop , wait, actually the best way to handle this would be to first get unit selection out of the way.
    So ruins == platformer and cities == top down rpg!
    Okay but before we get to that, we will have to make sure there are visual containers for both, and a couple other things like city borders.
    Additional structures we can add can be lumber camps and farms, with the lumber camp, wait hmm.
    Farm will provide +25 food per turn, but use -15 labor.
    Lumber camp would provide +25 labor, but use -15 food.

    **Astro**

    We got the `rareicon.com` to build and run under the dev without any major issues.
    However there are some issues with the threejs when trying to run the kbve under the custom astro command.
    Finally, we got the base of the astro to build and now we can bring back the main pipeline!
    We had almost three full weeks of down time but we did get a good list of packages to clean up.
    I will make new issue tickets for the packages that we might have to remove.

    **TSLA**

    Oh no! Almost the $300 mark!?
    We got two more days before those options expire, I am just hoping it does not cross the $300 mark and praying that we get a bit of room to extend out those calls.

    **Herbmail**

    We can keep it astro based but the template should be fixed up and replaced again.
    Yet before we do that , we need to adjust the astro build process for it as well.
    The changes will be the same as the other astro config changes we made earlier, so it should be quick.

    **Nx**

    Updating the nx instance to version `v20.0.11` and now looping back around and making sure that everything else works.
    There were some issues with the out-dated plugins but we can address them later this week.

	**ShadCN**

	Time to get the herbmail frontpage converted over to a shadcn based template.
	I wonder if we could do it all through chatgpt?
	Wild that in almost 2025 and the astro icons is still broken and not working out of the box?
	I am somewhat surprised that I might have to create and publish a working astro package for icons.
