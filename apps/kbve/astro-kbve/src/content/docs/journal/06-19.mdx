### Starting Stocks

-   05:50PM

    Going through the S&P 500 list and going to add each of the company listed, with the goal of having about 500 companies, before adding more of the random ones.
    After we get majority of the companies listed, then it will be the ETFs, REITS, CEFs, Bonds , ect...
    Furthermore, we will have to build tools to grab data and render the charts as well.

### Admin Schema + Table

-   08:49PM

    The next move would be fix the material view refresh and that means we would have to create basically an admin schema.
    This is the sql schema that we would create for admin.

```sql

-- Create the admin schema
create schema if not exists admin;

-- Revoke default PUBLIC access
revoke all on schema admin from public;

-- Revoke access to objects in the schema from anon/authenticated
revoke all on all tables in schema admin from anon, authenticated;
revoke all on all functions in schema admin from anon, authenticated;

-- Grant access to service_role
grant usage on schema admin to service_role;
grant select, insert, update, delete on all tables in schema admin to service_role;
grant execute on all functions in schema admin to service_role;

```

## 2024

**DevOps**

The library is officially released onto the NPM registry, you can see it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kbve/devops)!
I did notice that the image was a bit too big for the page, so from 540x540, I decided to resize it to 400x400.

Now we still need to test the library out in our github action test case but there are still some functions that are missing that we need to adjust for.
The next function that I am going to add into the library is the `_title` function and that will be used to clean up the issue ticket title before calling an action.
We want to make sure that it gets trimmed down to 64 characters and avoid generic regex attacks.
I am thinking there might be still some weird strings that might get through the filter, but we shall see.

The next issue seems that the npm package does not actually build the javascript files but rather just uploads the typescript files.
While this is okay, we still need it to build the actual javascript files too, which I think is because we do have not the right path setup within the `project.json`.

The most recent package release failed but I think its because we need to manually trigger the build?
Inside of the `ci-main.yml`, I went ahead and added a commmand to build the package.

```yaml
- name: Build KBVE DevOps NPM Package
  uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
  with:
    flag: '-nx devops:build'
    create_pull_request: false
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

We will build the application before preparing to publish it.


**Repo**

We will have to clean up the monorepo and remove a bunch of older libraries and dead projects, I am thinking of doing it slowly and making sure to back it all up as I do so.
Each instance should be saved in multiple areas, but we also want to make sure that we are not removing anything major that is required for anything in production.

Furthermore, we have to make sure any of the apps that get removed, also do not trigger any specific build.
I already went ahead and removed some of the itch builds, so our games would not get affected but I will have to go back and fix up the docker cicd builds.

The first project we can check to remove is the `js-embed-passport` and `js-embed-passport-e2e`.
