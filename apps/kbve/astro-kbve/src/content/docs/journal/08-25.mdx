**Roma**
Taking the two hour train from florence to rome but it means that I also know that this is an option in the future.
I was surprised with cost but its been pretty nice because we did take a small train around to get to here, so it could be seen as our reward!


**Drizzle**
There will be a couple changes that we will be doing with the `kilobase` project, the first will be the utilization of a couple different applications.
The first application will require a drizzle style integration, similar to that of planet scale but more focused on.
Ugh, we will have to setup the project folder for kilobase and work around it.

**KeyValue**
The more I was thinking about a key value system that would operate like redis/mysql but open to the whole world, kinda like a tracker but with the goal of offering small size key + value storage?
It could be so that the day is in JSON when being stored and grabbed, or we could work around making it a bucket friendly approach? 
The real goal would be to find a way to keep the sessions short enought that the data gets deleted within a reasonable time period.
We can also make this global key-vaule system utilize some of the cooler aspects of rust and planetscale, it would let us push the storage really in and out there.
The next question would be how large would we want to keep the key and value?
Wait, we could just make all the keys be the `ULID` and then have the data object attached to them?
This would help solve our time issue because we can check the date of the ulid ahead of time and we could work from there and try to establish other types of ulids.
That means the key is a binary 16? We could also just offer a straight bigInt as well, eviction based upon the large number object.
Okay the final part of the three key would be a hash? but I feel like that might be a bit of overkill, so we can try to be a bit creative with how we want to handle this.

- 8:00am - Getting ready for general roll call. We got another hackathon later tonight and this whole weekend, I am excited about it!
- 1:30pm - Started the backup test casing, defining the terraform for the recovery test case. For the backup plan, I believe I should aim for about once a quarter? Maybe we should do it a bit earlier. Hmmm... this Friday feels a bit slow for me, maybe because its about to be the memorial weekend? 
- 2:20pm - Finished the Claifai stream and now I am going to start working on the PAT / Personal Access Token for their service. 
- 4:45pm - One of the bigger issues with the
