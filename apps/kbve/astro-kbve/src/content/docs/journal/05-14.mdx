## 2025

### CICD Astro KBVE

-   01:15AM

    While building out the bento grid, it would make sense to finish up the astro build pipeline between our github repo and the gh pages.
    Testing this build pipeline would make sense because before the next meeting, I need the updated KBVE website operation with the JSON content.
    It is a shame that we did not get to resolve the svelte 5 issues but this rewrite was long over due.
    As for the future of the KBVE website, it is looking great, definitely if we can get the bento operational and get to utilize the droid library.

    Okay slight changes to the cicd, a couple stupid errors but I am also half asleep working on this, ugh.
    It feels like I am making my own deathstar, except for my soul.

### Andor

-   03:10AM

    Just finished the final episode of Andor season 2!
    It ends perfectly into the Rogue One and that is exactly what I wanted, now would be a great time to rewatch it and maybe the legacy star wars too.
    Ahh, a bit excited because its been so long since I seen any of the OG movies and this would be the perfect time to watch it again.

### Bento Droid

-   03:20AM

    The Bento grid module will operate like this:

```
   Worker Thread (mod-bento.worker.ts)
        |
        |  ──> BentoTile → emits → { type: 'injectTile', tile }
        |
        ↓
   Main Thread (uiux.emitFromWorker)
        |
        ├─> injectBentoTile(tile)
        └─> injectBentoCanvasTile(id, options)

```

    This means we need to update the uiux to include a bridge or an emit-style helper function to transfer over objects that get created by the workers.
    There are three ways we can do this, but for now I am going to try and maybe proxy + transfer the objects.
    If that fails then we could manually do a post message but that would be outside of the comlink communication and we do not want that.

### KBVE HomePage

-   06:31PM

    The homepage is finally coming along, there still some minor changes that I need to add but I think I can do it both via static astro AND through injection.
    Okay, this is good because we just need to move over the docs and should be able to launch a solid website within the next 48 hours.
    
-   08:40PM

    Docs are next! I am testing the astropad build and there does not seem to be a problem so far.
    Since it builds, the next move would be to change the vault symbolic link.

### Droid Canvas Worker

-   06:47PM

    There was an issue with how I was importing the canvas worker on the droid library but I was able to get it resolved.
    Next issue to handle will be migrating the rest of the doc files over to the new site!
    Once that is done, I will loop back and fix any of the issues with the new collections, aka journal and arcade.
    Finally, I will add the discord, contact, support and misc routes and then we can switch over to the new website!


## 2024

**GME**

The $60+ pop this morning was insane!

**Lottie**

Updated the [javascript](https://kbve.com/application/javascript/) documentation for Lottie and included a quick lottie-web example.

**RareIcon**

Currently planning out a quick mini game jam for the next couple days!
We could combine all of the previous games into one unified game and then pipeline it out to Steam.
The theme for the gamejam is `Aqua` and I am going to head towards a Zelda-style mockup.

**TailwindCSS**

I updated the documentation around the TailwindCSS within the javascript docs, and now it would be time to migrate all the tailwindcss examples into the document.
Yet before I do that, I need to build a new component to help render the tailwindcss as a preview.
I am thinking of using this `html-react-parser` library to help render the example tailwindcss code.

We had to add a syntax highlighter and decided to change the default code layout to be "shadesOfPurple", which looks great in both light and dark mode!
