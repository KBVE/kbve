## Notes

## 2025

-   08:31PM

    **Tesla**

    About to grab some food and swing back around for the python application as v1.
    Then we do a rust application for v2.
    Ugh, taco bell adventures...

# 2024

- 11:31am - Had to drop my tesla off for some minor repairs before the winter gets worse.

- 12:05pm - After the kbveproto.proto is generated and patched, we have to prepare a javascript version.
    I am thinking to extend out the shell script so that after it finishes patching the init. proto file, it will then generate the js proto.
    We will have it create the js file in the `/packages/kbve/src/` folder and then move that file over `/packages/khashvault/src/lib/`
    The command to generate the protoc:
        ```shell
        protoc --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:. src/kbveproto.proto
        ```
    Hmm, before I run the generation, I am thinking that I might copy the proto over to the khashvault location.
    Okay so it seems that the protoc library does not support typescript out of the box, so I have two options:
        - `protoc-gen-ts` and `grpc-tools`.
        Of the two options, I will be using the `grpc-tools` with `grpc_tools_node_protoc_ts`, which can be installed using this command:
        ```shell
            pnpm i grpc-tools grpc_tools_node_protoc_ts -D
        ```
    After installing the two packages, I believe I might need another, `google-protobuf` but I have to double check the notes for the client-side requirements.

- 1:48pm - I am going to take a break from the Protobuf and begin building the `engine.ts` within the `khashvault`!
    Going to migrate the `kbve.ts` from the `Astro-ve` into the `khash-vault` package.
