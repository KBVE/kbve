## Notes


## 2025

### GameJam B13

-   07:45AM

    The brackeys 13 gamejam has been a blast, finally got a better understanding of the godot signals and the way to handle the 2D animations.
    However the UI/UX has been crazy, there have been some interesting aspects but also super confusion, some parts of the UI have been driving me crazy.

-   11:40AM

    Exhaust has been done, now I need to make some updates on how to call it without it affecting the shield.
    

## 2024


### Tickets

I feel like a ticket system works well when keeping track of the conflicts, bugs, upgrades, but no one seems to really answer them.
However, I should just keep to myself and continue to answer tickets, even if it means that I am talking to myself? I feel like the premise of the tickets are just to cover yourself.

I should look further into developing out the AI ticket response system but that is still way down the pipeline.


### NVDA

It will be an interesting earnings call, I am hoping that it wont fall under `$650` but I also do not need it to really go past a `$850`.
The market will swing any away, we shall see!
The whole tech market might even shift based upon the


### NX

The pipeline froze a bit earlier during the dev cycle, I believe it might have been because of too many changes before the actions would settle.
I will try to think of a better system to handle the pull and merge requests, ideally one that can help automate the code review to a certain aspect.


### WASM

We were able to get the WASM embed to push into two different folders, one for HerbMail.com, which is a placeholder for the public facing test case.
The other one that I added today is for the next KBVE.com release, both of which are done via NX and a custom shell script.

Now the next issue would be to update the `wasm.md` to either a new `wasm.mdx` or something unique for the tool.
However I am thinking of isolating the tools to their own custom astro file.

This will just make the process of building the tools out easier for other websites too.


### RSPS

Decided to pickup another account for our adventures! Obviously I will not include the name but we shall see how far we can get with this!

I think if we plan around it and make sure everything works, then we should not have any major issues. Let us see how everything plays out over time.
