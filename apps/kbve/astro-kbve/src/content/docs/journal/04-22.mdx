## 2025

### Svelte 5

-   08:00AM

    Got the panel openning inside of the svelte 5 component!
    We can slowly phase out some of the alpine integrations once we get the HTML pre-rendering to work out any major issues.

### Helm Discordsh

-   08:04AM

    The older discordsh helm template has an issue with the cluster roles, which we need to fix.
    Okay the issue with the cluster roles has been resolved as of right now, so we can go ahead and push up the next couple changes.
    After everything builds, we can update the deployment charts with the new image.

-   02:59PM

    The most recent deployment of discordsh is operational at version 1.2, and I went ahead and checked the redis registering too.
    As a basic tradition, I will review over the performance and start making tweaks to the redis.
    Added some missing files and now going to push that up, will do another review next.

### Astro Tweaks

-   05:21PM

    Since we are not going to be using React, going to go ahead and remove that from the Astro configurations.
    After that, we can make some tweaks to the `askama.astro` template, including the removal of the `Layout` template.
    The information from the layout will have to be generated ahead of time.

### Kubernetes Ingress

-   05:53PM

    For the gzip compression, we have to update the nginx to pass through the gz files from Axum.
    After making sure that the files do not get double compressed, we still have two more tweaks to be made.
    Gzip all the static files inside of the dist folder and update the axum to include the basic cache layer, both of which can be done easily from our end!
    The goal will be to hit the 100 performance metric across the board on the Google Pagefind.
    Wait, we could just run through the astro compress, which seems to be able to handle that for us, thus it be just the axum that we need to append.

## 2024

The journal entry for today will be a bit behind because I have to update the template that we are using!

## 2023

**PAN**

-   Finished getting my PAN number in India and all my accounts are open! Time to plan and start to generate `Rupees`. I can generate about 5 Lakhs or 500,000 rupees tax free each year, so I guess that will be the current goal. Furthermore, UPI seems to come to US / International numbers at the end of this month.

**Appwrite**

-   Currently looking over the Astro repo on AppWrite, which is located here, `https://github.com/appwrite/demos-for-astro/` and the specific file of interest is in their lib folder, `appwrite.ts`.

-   I went ahead and added their AppWrite.ts file into the KBVE repo and going through it. The concept seems pretty straight forward and we have not ran into any major issues so far.

-   Back on the AppWrite integration, I believe their might be CORS issues between the API/AP (https://ap.kbve.com/) and the main website, https://kbve.com/. The first move would be to get the user management resolved, including the

**Crypto**

-   Following up on this story from @Fudster, [Colorado Accepts Crypto for State Taxes](https://abcnews.go.com/ABCNews/colorado-state-accept-cryptocurrency-payment-taxes/story?id=83066842) It is nice to see the organic growth of crypto from the gov. entity side. Accroding to their website, they accept crypto payments through `PayPal Cryptocurrencies Hub` and the official guidelines can be seen on their [payment portal](https://www.colorado.gov/revenueonline/_/#1).
