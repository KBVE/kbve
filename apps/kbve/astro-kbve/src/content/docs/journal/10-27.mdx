### Playful Ai Virtual Jam

-   2:03AM

    This jam was a bit sad but I am going to continue to work on the game.
    We ran into a bunch of issues with the UI, I even tried to change the shader control, but honestly, the rust ffi is so much better.

### CityVote

-   09:15PM

    Time to just fully commit to finishing the gamejam, having it under a completely new name.
    Well not new, but it might be time to bring the CityVote game to full force.

    **Docker**

    I am still having some issues with the python and java websocket communication.
    If dynamically loading the packages does not work, then I think it would make sense to do the hybrid build path.
    The command that would be `dynamic` will then try to load the function dynamically but we could have `execute` , `reset`, ect... as commands that can run without having to load the function.
    This way we can move forward with the production of the scripts.

    **Highlander**

    Nothing like closing the month out with the best series, `Highalnder`, which is like unlocking a core memory!
    One of the best tv shows I think I have seen in my life, I just love the lore and backstory.

    **Atlas**

    Another day to focus on the atlas deployment, lets go ahead and spin it up.
    To create the container, we will run:

    ```shell
    pnpm xn container atlas
    ```
    
    Then to throw it up, we will do:
    
    ```shell
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -p 8086:8086 kbve/atlas:1.42
    ```

    I should place them into the readme.

    **Hellboy**

    Yay! The next movie after Scooby-Doo, 2002, we are watching the next hellboy movie and its perfect.
    If you think about it, they would be a great cross over movie.

    Ah to keep the notes up to date and follow the base format, I need to create a new entry each midnight.
