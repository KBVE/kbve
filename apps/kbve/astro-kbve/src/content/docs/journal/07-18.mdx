## 2024

**Once Human**

Spent a majority of the day getting the once human running!
I wanted to play the game using a controller and it was a bit of a pain to get it all going.
The only major downside is that there are way too many combos and buttons to press, so playing the game on the side is a bit rough.
In order to get the full controller support to work requires you to run Steam as an Admin and then enable the steam input support override.


## 2023
- 8:00am - Before I begin the pipeline for the Android build, I need to make sure that the keys are setup in the right way. The path that I will end up taking will be to utilize the Github Actions to build the APK, or I could go through with a private Gitlab instance? However I was planning to build multiple applications and I wanted to make sure some of the projects are open source for future programmers to look through.
- 2:28pm - Double checking all my positions within the market and I am a bit sad that this feels closer to a bear trap. I wonder if the feds will keep increasing the rates and how it will impact the rest of 2023.
- 3:48pm - At this current rate, even adding an additional 16 shares of WPC took around $1000 in capital. This means that I will have to start doing R&D and finding other ways to increase the amount of capital that I can generate. I might have to enter another realm of hustling, but I do miss those days lately, being behind this computer screen is slowly reaching some of its peak. I can sense the burnout coming down the line within the next couple months, hmm, I will have to figure out something short term, at least to generate another $4000 a month. 
- 5:33pm - I think I will take a break from the PC really quick and do some chores. Laundry and mowing the lawn sound like they be great tasks to do really quick!
