### CityVote Docker Image

-	05:45PM

	While working out the bugs within the combat loop, I am going to also look into handling the docker image for the game.
	The website should be built the same way that we did the other ones, using astro and axum would make the most sense.
	`astro-cityvote` and then have it build into `cityvote-deployment` or something of that nature, and finally setup the kube deployment.

	**PostTrump**

	Looks like the elections are over and we can all finally move on.
	It was way too long of a process and I am so glad this poopfest is officially over.
	Too many people, too many opinions, just a massive rat nest with emotional baggage in each nanometer.

	**Astro**

	To test case the astro migration, I think it would make sense to start with an example repo?
	Let us try to use the rareicon as an example repo that we can build around.
	Eventually we want to either swap it out with a tamagui interface or maybe keep the astro for the landing page.
	Then release an app.rareicon.com for the expo build, but regardless, we will need to migrate and replace the nx extension.
	To get started, we will have to replace the `tsconfig.json` and manually handle some of the linking.
	We can replace this: `"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",` with a direct reference to astro's ts base.
	Okay this fix seems to work for `rareicon.com`
	We could also update the `.gitignore` to not add in the `src` folder that gets created.

	**BrighterShores**

	Working on a quick proof of concept for a python automation script, hmm, there might be some adjustments that I will have to do but it should work fine.
	The way that I am thinking about it would be to keep it simple, a small auto combat bot and maybe a small cooking bot?
	Both of these would be an easy task to automate and it would be a fun challenge.
	Now that would mean setting up the python auto gui for the `fudster` library, hmm, I wonder if there might be a way around it without using python directly?
	It might just be too much for this test casing, I will stick with the base python library.
	We would have to automate the steam login, hmm, I am thinking we can skip that part too and just have it focus on the general gameplay.
	Now to install and run steam will be interesting, damn, that would mean adding the `steam` package into the container as well.

	Okay when going into the 2nd episode of the brightershores, there is a bit of a skill adjustment, with combating being reset? 
	I am thinking there might be a reason for having the split combat but the fact that the items are also split by the episode makes this way too annoying.
	After spending a solid day playing through the game and giving it a fair shot, I am going to say that it might be best to let the game go.
	I will come back around when the game leaves beta and makes a bit more adjustments, it is definitely not worth the $6 a month either.

	**League**

	Time for a quick league match, while I am playing brighter shores on the side.
	The new aram map looks amazing, they did a great job with it!
