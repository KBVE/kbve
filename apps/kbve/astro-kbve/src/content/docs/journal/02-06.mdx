## Notes

## 2025

### Markets

-   03:37PM

    With the president making sweeping orders and the short boom and bust cycles, it feels like just riding the waves has been the best appoarch.
    Nvidia climbing back up to pre-130, I am a bit excited to see where the stock will be after the earnings report in 3 weeks from now.

### Rust

-   04:09PM

    Updating the code again to include the `UserCache` and `GUI` modules, hopefully we can extend this all out before the end of this week.
    My goals are to continue to build around the core-gameplay and make it optimize, fast and interesting!

    **UserCache**
    
    The user-cache could be just an extension of our `ResourceCache` , but I am thinking that we want to include a way to save the settings.
    Thus it would make sense to isolate the user settings, such that, it will save the data locally on the machine.
    There were a couple additional things that I wanted to include in the user cache, but that will come after the gameplay.

    **Abstract**

    The next move would be to include an abstract map that will hold some of the user values.

### URF

-   07:19PM

    Taking a quick league break but eh, I find the ARURF to be just a bit too much.
    I think I am actually geting tired of league and it might be because of hardcore wow too.

### Quote

-   09:55PM

    `a weakness in cartography, a curse of homosexuality` - from Wes's movie, the French Dispatch and I was a bit confused?
    I thought about it and I think the joke is that they do not walk `straight`.

## 2024

#### sheet

Spent majority of the day working out the kinks within the character sheet!
I was able to get the SVG generated with the basic dragon frame and general lines for the text.
Sadly a decent chunk of my time was then spent re-building the validator, which I had to change because the async + sync was breaking the builder during a shared state.

I spent a decent amount of time going through the validator concept and decided that it would be best to just create a whole new builder AsyncValidator, instead of having them shared as one instance.

This does mean that I have to go back and rebuild the new AsyncValidator but it will be worth it in the long run, since I will be placing those validators inside of the jedi crate, so I can re-use them for future applications.


#### WoW

Decided to run a quick couple levels on my new paladin, holyjedi, taking advantage of the 50% exp buff to level 25!
The leveling with the pally is really easy and this buff makes grinding almost painless, I been just hacking away on the side with my controller.

#### Bathroom

Ended up spending a couple hours on multiple trips to HomeDepot!
The first issue was a leak with the bathroom, but we were able to resolve that because it seemed to be caused by birds.
They had established a nest inside of the wall, ugh and damaged the vents and basically were the reason for the minor leaks.
The humidity was not able to escape since the vents were no longer functional, so the condense water vapor basically formed a pool of water for the birds?
I am not too sure exactly how it all went down, but these birds basically turned my guest bathroom into their own mini apartment.
