## Notes

## 2025

### B13 Global Resources

-   04:45PM

    The global resources will be held under a singleton that will make it easier to call anywhere within the application.
    By moving all our variables into there, we can use them in both the asteroid scene and also call them in the UI.

-   06:24PM

    The Omniscope will be where the weapons are fired off from and a node called `Projectiles` will hold the different bullets and lasers that get fired off.

-   09:13PM

    Took some time to add in the projectile pooling but I am glad that it worked out!
    There are still some issues with the signals, hmm, it might be because they have not fully clicked.
    Events are always a black magic for my brain.

### Flex

The flex box for the frontpage should work on various platforms but I need to make sure that it would display them in a neat and responsive order.
One of the ways that I was thinking of handling this would be to use flex with flex-wrap, the good old flexbox approach.

I also need to make sure that the WASM will work on the main website, which is another adventure that I need to plan out.

Hopefully we can get this all resovled within this week!

The current solution to the flex box would be something like this:

```html

    <div
        class="h-full w-full items-start justify-start rounded-tl flex flex-wrap gap-4 overflow-y-scroll content-start p-3 ">
            <span>Content</span>
    </div>

```
The flex, flex-wrap and content-start help align all the `section` containers within the flexbox and it seems to be responsive!

Now I want to see how it will work with different size cards and if it can fit them in without any issues.

For testing the flexbox, I am going to create some placeholder elements and see how they would render within the box.
The first filler component is the `hero.astro`, which will be a generic hero element.




### VM

The Windows machine needed a quick restart but we were able to get the sound up and running!
Good work fudster on finding the patch!
Now there are some issues with the audio, including the decoding and the feedback is scratching or skipping.
