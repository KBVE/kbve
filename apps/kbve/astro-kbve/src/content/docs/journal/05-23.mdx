## 2024

**SCAR**

I was thinking about the different ways that we could handle the plugins within our library.
We want to make sure that there are a couple open source plugins that people can access and use without any costs, this will also make it easier for future developers to build their own plugins.
Yet we also want to make sure that there is a way to provide these users with a plugin store, ideally one with premium software too.

Now the question is how would we go about offering the premium plugins?
I am thinking that the two main bindings that we can offer would be in C and Rust, then a third option for just straight Python.
As for Javascript, since it is integrated with the website, we could just work that into the mix at the client side. 

I have a basic idea for the plugin shop in the my head. 

**TailwindCSS Buttons**

We still have a bit of ways to go with the next generation of buttons.
I started to mess around with a couple proof of concepts earlier in the day!

**Home Page**

Let me update the SVGs on the front page of KBVE, replacing the random company logos with something a bit more fitting, maybe a reference to our documentation.
The five svgs for the front page will be a direct link to our notes.
Furthermore, we will be removing that featured image for now until we have something worth wild to place there.

## 2023

- 6:00am - I got the notification of the $SPY assignment, so besides getting ready for the market, I need to do some quick workouts. I might take a nap because I am tired doe!
- 9:00am - City vote does need a new website, layout and a general sense of direction. The best move to make would be to get the initial foundation and business plan laid out. The scope of the plan should include the basic cashflow, growth and purpose of the website.
- 11:00am - Rebuilt my scan setup, with the files being automatically stored into Google Drive. One of the other areas that I was looking into was setting OCR, so that every file that I scan would automatically generate a document with OCR. The problem that I was facing right now was getting it to perform a bit better? It would have some issues with characters, even though they were printed? This means either the OCR software is a bit outdated or maybe I need to create an All in One / AiO type setup. I think after I finish up the Cityvote and have a bit more time on my hands, I will have that be my next project, an open source OCR software that uses multiple libraries and some machine learning to get the based position markdown output from any document and/or image. 
- 3:00pm - I will be looking through, reading and learning how to build async constructors in JavaScript for most of the night. Boring!
