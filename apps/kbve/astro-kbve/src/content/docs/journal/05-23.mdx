## 2025

### Astro KBVE Build Preview

-   04:40AM

    Adding a quick build preview command because it would make more sense for us to do it that way since we are not getting errors.
    The classic works in `dev` but breaks in `production`, I suppose we can use astro tests to figure that out as well but that will be after this bug.

### Dice Fiber Problem

-   04:51PM

    The biggest issue that is breaking the kbve website right now is the react fiber!
    I am thinking its just an issue with how Astro and React are handling the client side code and its becoming a pain point.
    I decided to drop my rating for Astro to `8.7/10`, and its slowly reaching that B tier, which is a shame.

-   05:06PM

    Maybe we nest the dice into another component using a reference point and calling the fiber directly.
    I am not too sure if this is because of react `19.1` or if something in our library is missing, hmm.
    This is a bug that might just not be worth it for now, so I will just leave it as an endless spin for now.

### KBVE v3 Website Deployed

-   08:02PM

    Okay, the website has been deployed further and we got the shared workers operational, at least from what I am seeing for now.
    Since tomorrow is the Unity meeting, I figured it would make sense that we shift focus back towards the ItemDB and get that setup asap.

-   08:10PM

    The ItemDB will just be the `/itemdb/` + `$name` and we can just build it like that, making it easier to reference.
    Now how we build the zod for the itemdb will still be an issue that I need to resolve, ugh.

**SCAR**

I was thinking about the different ways that we could handle the plugins within our library.
We want to make sure that there are a couple open source plugins that people can access and use without any costs, this will also make it easier for future developers to build their own plugins.
Yet we also want to make sure that there is a way to provide these users with a plugin store, ideally one with premium software too.

Now the question is how would we go about offering the premium plugins?
I am thinking that the two main bindings that we can offer would be in C and Rust, then a third option for just straight Python.
As for Javascript, since it is integrated with the website, we could just work that into the mix at the client side. 

I have a basic idea for the plugin shop in the my head. 

**TailwindCSS Buttons**

We still have a bit of ways to go with the next generation of buttons.
I started to mess around with a couple proof of concepts earlier in the day!

**Home Page**

Let me update the SVGs on the front page of KBVE, replacing the random company logos with something a bit more fitting, maybe a reference to our documentation.
The five svgs for the front page will be a direct link to our notes.
Furthermore, we will be removing that featured image for now until we have something worth wild to place there.

## 2023

- 6:00am - I got the notification of the $SPY assignment, so besides getting ready for the market, I need to do some quick workouts. I might take a nap because I am tired doe!
- 9:00am - City vote does need a new website, layout and a general sense of direction. The best move to make would be to get the initial foundation and business plan laid out. The scope of the plan should include the basic cashflow, growth and purpose of the website.
- 11:00am - Rebuilt my scan setup, with the files being automatically stored into Google Drive. One of the other areas that I was looking into was setting OCR, so that every file that I scan would automatically generate a document with OCR. The problem that I was facing right now was getting it to perform a bit better? It would have some issues with characters, even though they were printed? This means either the OCR software is a bit outdated or maybe I need to create an All in One / AiO type setup. I think after I finish up the Cityvote and have a bit more time on my hands, I will have that be my next project, an open source OCR software that uses multiple libraries and some machine learning to get the based position markdown output from any document and/or image. 
- 3:00pm - I will be looking through, reading and learning how to build async constructors in JavaScript for most of the night. Boring!
