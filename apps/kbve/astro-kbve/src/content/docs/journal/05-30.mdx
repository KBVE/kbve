## 2025

### Item 31 - Fish Taco

-   02:35AM

    Taking a quick break from the CharacterData orchestration and decided on the next item!
    For id 31, we will do the classic, fried fish tacoes!
    Going to push that up now, but damn, I should look into hiring a person to just help me with the itemdb.

-  02:40AM

    The next item will be the "Grilled Fish Burrito" which will be a more complex item that will require some additional work.
    Making these items late at night is definitely a fun way to unwind after a long day of coding, but its also making me hungry, gahh.
    Lets go ahead and throw this up too before going back to the CharacterData orchestration.
    Item 32 - Grilled Fish Burrito.

-  02:51AM

    Next item will be the mexican pizza like clone, we will call it the tex mex pizza.
    Afterwards, I will do some BBQ ribs, burgers and maybe some other cool dishes that I can think of.


### Character Registrar

-  02:53AM

    While building the next couple items, it would make sense to focus on the unity side again.
    I did not like the fact that we had to hardcode the character event register but its okay for now.


## 2024

Taking a quick break from Programming and just melting my mind in that sweet sweet baby rays of RM!

Updated journal comes later on.

## 2023

- 9:00am - Going to see if I can sell a couple cover calls and covered puts on a collection of stocks. I am looking to see if I can get into another position on $NVDA , I am looking at $380 puts this week. Furthermore, maybe enter $TSLA at under $190 and $SPY again for under $420.
- 11:00am - Restructuring the AI cloud functions so that we can encapsulate it all into microservices. We are currently running about 3-5 different instances within KBVE but we could abstract out another 10-20 more 3rd party instances, that are then wrapped inside of the KBVE cloud functions. 
- 3:00pm - Woke up from a nap, going to go install a backup camera onto two of the older cars in my family's fleet. The total install cost for two 7 inch backup cameras comes in at around $400 each, I am trying to see if I can get it down to $700 or maybe work out another deal with the guy.
- 5:00pm - The shadow magic conch shell is looking better and better! I should throw up a test case for people to see under the official url of [conch](https://kbve.com/tools/conch/). I hope everyone enjoys the absolute memes that this tool will become.
