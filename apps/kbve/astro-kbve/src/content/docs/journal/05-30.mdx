### Item 31 - Fish Taco

-   02:35AM

    Taking a quick break from the CharacterData orchestration and decided on the next item!
    For id 31, we will do the classic, fried fish tacos!
    Going to push that up now, but damn, I should look into hiring a person to just help me with the itemdb.

-  02:40AM

    The next item will be the "Grilled Fish Burrito" which will be a more complex item that will require some additional work.
    Making these items late at night is definitely a fun way to unwind after a long day of coding, but its also making me hungry, gahh.
    Lets go ahead and throw this up too before going back to the CharacterData orchestration.
    Item 32 - Grilled Fish Burrito.

-  02:51AM

    Next item will be the mexican pizza like clone, we will call it the tex mex pizza.
    Afterwards, I will do some BBQ ribs, burgers and maybe some other cool dishes that I can think of.

-   03:59AM

    Item 37 , swiss cheese and item 38 will be cheddar cheese.
    Actually we should throw in pepper jack too for now, hmm that means we will need tomatoes and a pasta sauce too?
    Damn, all of this cooking is going to be wild, easily get to 100 items from just the cooking alone.

### Character Registrar

-   02:53AM

    While building the next couple items, it would make sense to focus on the unity side again.
    I did not like the fact that we had to hardcode the character event register but its okay for now.

-   04:15PM

    Okay so the registrar loads the first origin character, but it needs to loop through all the other characters that would be added.
    There are three issues that I am trying to address, the first is that we are hardcoding the search for `PlayerID1` , which we don't want to do.
    Second issue is that multiple playerIDs can exist, so it loops back to the first issue as well.
    Finally the third issue is that there are multiple characters per playerID, the goal for the Registrar is to place all that of data into a complete map.
    Eventually we can move this into a rust-based ffi papaya map, moving away from this C# dictionary approach but that will come with other concerns and issues that we do not want to deal with.

-   05:31PM

    In a situation where an additional character loads in or a friend joins a lobby, we need to handle that event and make sure there is no de-sync.
    Thus, we need to include an additional helper.


## 2024

Taking a quick break from Programming and just melting my mind in that sweet sweet baby rays of RM!

Updated journal comes later on.

## 2023

- 9:00am - Going to see if I can sell a couple cover calls and covered puts on a collection of stocks. I am looking to see if I can get into another position on $NVDA , I am looking at $380 puts this week. Furthermore, maybe enter $TSLA at under $190 and $SPY again for under $420.
- 11:00am - Restructuring the AI cloud functions so that we can encapsulate it all into microservices. We are currently running about 3-5 different instances within KBVE but we could abstract out another 10-20 more 3rd party instances, that are then wrapped inside of the KBVE cloud functions. 
- 3:00pm - Woke up from a nap, going to go install a backup camera onto two of the older cars in my family's fleet. The total install cost for two 7 inch backup cameras comes in at around $400 each, I am trying to see if I can get it down to $700 or maybe work out another deal with the guy.
- 5:00pm - The shadow magic conch shell is looking better and better! I should throw up a test case for people to see under the official url of [conch](https://kbve.com/tools/conch/). I hope everyone enjoys the absolute memes that this tool will become.
