## 2025

-   09:04AM

    **Morning**

    Next day! Almost refreshed and ready for this whole year!
    Its actually cool to be able to loop back finally, but this year is going to be wild and amazing.

-   10:00AM

    **Rimworld**

    As tradition, the first session of the year should be a rimworld playthrough, I been dying to try that rimworld clone wars mod!
    I am going to update the rimworld notes to quickly grab them.

-   02:42PM

    **Kilobase**

    Updated the kanban board from the postgres side and made sure the older kanban tables were removed.
    We will store all that date inside of the Amazon dynamodb but I need to figure out the best way to handle the timestamps for the tables, hmm.
    Looks like that TTL is an option in from the Amazon docs but I will have switch back and look through how to call it in Rust.

## 2024

- 10:22am - It is 2024, this might be a bit out there but I think 2025 will come really fast.

- 11:54am - Going to clean up the SQL queries for generating the backend tables!
    There were a couple issues with the migration that I had to handle manually, so I decided to just restart the generation process.

- 12:13pm - After cleaning up the SQL generations, I am going to switch back to migrating some of the Obby vaults from `kbve.com`.

- 3:23pm - The one thing that is a bit annoying is that completing some of the documentations will take a while! Hmm...
    I guess its like having a library of books but a decent chunk of them are missing pages and/or chapters, but as of right now it seems to be the best way to handle it.
