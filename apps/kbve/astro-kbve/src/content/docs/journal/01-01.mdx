## 2026

### OSRS Over Allocation Issue

-   04:45PM

    Updating the OSRS axum routes, mainly reducing the allocation from 4 strings down to a single one.
    However we can not go zero allocation because of the mpsc, which might be an issue in the future.
    There is a way we could avoid the cache actor and directly hook into the dashmap, but that might hurt our scaling.
    For reference, we are using the tokio's sync mpsc rather than the std mpsc channel. 

### Content Margin/Padding

-   07:29PM

    Finally figured out the issue with the starlight theme causing some weird element issues!
    Turns out that I need to add the `not-content` css tag to anything that might conflict with our starlight theme, allowing us to just not have any of their overrides.
    This should solve some of the button issues we had earlier as well.
    Going to implement this fix, hopefully it will resolve the other margin issues with the OSRS.

### Phaser Quick Game

-   08:36PM

    Maybe we could update parts of the Arcade to include some quick games to play via Phaser.
    It has been a while since we made a simple game, might be a simple runner!

## 2025

-   09:04AM

    **Morning**

    Next day! Almost refreshed and ready for this whole year!
    Its actually cool to be able to loop back finally, but this year is going to be wild and amazing.

-   10:00AM

    **Rimworld**

    As tradition, the first session of the year should be a rimworld playthrough, I been dying to try that rimworld clone wars mod!
    I am going to update the rimworld notes to quickly grab them.

-   02:42PM

    **Kilobase**

    Updated the kanban board from the postgres side and made sure the older kanban tables were removed.
    We will store all that date inside of the Amazon dynamodb but I need to figure out the best way to handle the timestamps for the tables, hmm.
    Looks like that TTL is an option in from the Amazon docs but I will have switch back and look through how to call it in Rust.

## 2024

- 10:22am - It is 2024, this might be a bit out there but I think 2025 will come really fast.

- 11:54am - Going to clean up the SQL queries for generating the backend tables!
    There were a couple issues with the migration that I had to handle manually, so I decided to just restart the generation process.

- 12:13pm - After cleaning up the SQL generations, I am going to switch back to migrating some of the Obby vaults from `kbve.com`.

- 3:23pm - The one thing that is a bit annoying is that completing some of the documentations will take a while! Hmm...
    I guess its like having a library of books but a decent chunk of them are missing pages and/or chapters, but as of right now it seems to be the best way to handle it.
