### 10th ItemDB

-   05:51PM

    The 10th item was added into the itemdb!
    Actually we could be close to hitting that 25 items before the end of the week, but they still need to be polished and fixed up.
    I believe it would make sense to get a decent cluster of basic items added into the game, then we test them out and loop back around for any adjustments that need to be made.
    One issue that I just realized was that the tick system might have to be adjusted for not just damage but for crafting and farming, so a skill tick.
    I will have to adjust the schema for the different item classes, not just the drop rates and rarity but also what those items can repair and utilize.
    While expanding the item library, I should split the notes on the development from the unity side.

    Item 12! The Air Fryer!
    I should expand the recipes on KBVE and integrate them directly into the game.
    The company that will be creating this air fryer will be `Krispee`, the perfect name for a future air fryer company lmao.


### 14th ItemDB

-   07:26PM

    Next item to add will be the one that might help with the lighting, skull candle?
    Lets go ahead and ship something similar, ah wait bees too, okay that will be item 15th, aka hive and 16th the bees wax. 

### 16th ItemDB

-   08:44PM

    Bees Wax!
    If I can get the production of items even faster, than we could easily hit around that 100 items goal within end of june.
    Anyhow, I am going to try and filter through my whole list, looking for as many items that I can think of and add into the game.
    I will try to also link them ahead of time, so that they will not be all over the place, forming a bit of a logical chain.
    This will make the automatic integration of them into the game even easier.
    The bees wax will be used for the candles and medicine for now, I will try and expand it out for other things later on, maybe like weapon stuff.
    Oh besides medicine, I should use it for soap too, hmm okay but that will be for the future.

### ItemDB Use Integration

-   05:57PM

    The item prefab creation is good to go and we have it insert into the asset database, but there is still a decent amount of work to do.
    I am thinking that it be interesting if we could wire up a placeholder for the Steam / Multiplayer while we deploy the orchestrator.
    These are just notes for myself, I will loop back around to them incase I forgot the flow.

## 2024

**Python**

I am still trying to figure out the best way for me to run kubernetes!
A part of me wants to run the kubernetes , aka a k3s, inside of the Atlas docker image but that might be too much work.
I could integrate the portainer cli and maybe have atlas make calls to any docker instance! Hmm, so many options and yet so little time to figure them all out.


**SCAR**

Even if we get SCAR setup, it might just not be worth it, I am thinking of skipping that part directly and focusing on automating some of the chrome-based things.

**OVH**

It looks like our OVH dedicated server is reaching its max size!
I am going to have to either upgrade that dedicated server or wait until the contract runs out?

Actually given that we moved the majority of our main database to PlanetScale, we might not even need this dedicated server.
Hmm, the contract ends in December, so we have some time to renew and maybe ask for upgrades.

## 2023

- 9:00am This was a rough Saturday morning as well, I might have to start sleeping a bit earlier because it is definitely getting a bit too late.
- 10:30am - Finally bought my cooking skill cape on `TwitchKBVE` on OSRS and started to look into certain profit makers for the account that I can do while I am afking it. ;)
- 3:00pm - The major focus for the day will be getting the CityVote scrapper to be functional under a new docker container that uses the Node-Python as a base.
- 11:00pm - I am thinking of trying a new main support because of Shaco bans, I tried Senna but she really was not my play style, so I am going to pickup Sej again! She plays a bit different from the rework, I do miss the stack of ages build on her. Back then you could have like 3-4 Rod of Ages stacked and have a ton of AP / HP / Mana over the course of the game.
