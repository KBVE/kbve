## 2024

**Python**

The next update to the python library will be to manage the VNC instance directly.
While we wait for the next branch to reach production with the properties file for Runelite, I will start test casing the different click styles and the data movement.

I decided to add a function to stop the runelite client, which follows the same logic as the start function.

Incase I forget, the location to build the Atlas library is `/apps/atlas/` and the command to run the build is `docker build . -t myapp`.
It really is taking a hit to my CPU, this might make development work a bit of a pain as the library grows.

We could offload the integration testing once it gets stable to portainer but even then, there would be such a high usage in resources! Ugh!

After pushing the updated `default.properties` to the runelite outpost, we can pull it within our updated python script and place it where it needs to be.
Current location : `https://kbve.com/data/outpost/runelite/default.properties`

We know that the default profiles would be stored in this location: `~/.runelite/profiles2/` 

When the Runelite loads, it creates a `profiles.json`, which is here: 

```json

{"profiles":[{"id":-1,"name":"$rsprofile","sync":true,"active":false,"rev":-1,"defaultForRsProfiles":[]},{"id":41056315715238,"name":"default","sync":false,"active":true,"rev":-1,"defaultForRsProfiles":[]}]}

```

I need to now download the default.properties from the outpost and then name it `default-41056315715238.properties` , with the id from the profiles.json.

**LoL**

League just did a major update with their patch 14.10!
I am kinda excited for the new items and the return of my old favorites.

**Music**

Going to try to aim at around 30 more songs into the jukebox this week.


**Bullet Train 2022**

Just finished watching the bullet train, it was a solid piece of work!
The storyline ties together very well and I was entertained throughout the whole movie, it gets a solid 8 out of 10 in my review.

## 2023

- 9:00am - When I was taking my mom to her doctor's office, I noticed that they were using a full react-based eco-system! The patients would have tablets, where they would sign forms, fill out and double check their information, schedule and more!
- 12:00pm - Spent some of the time going through the Unity project. I still need to do some updates here and there with some plugins however they might break the game in other areas. I believe test casing or a system to test case the game might have to be on my agenda down the line.
- 2:00pm - Quick workout session , some minor chores, damn laundry! 
- 3:00pm - One Piece, league and programming session aka Memegramming! I am trying to rotate out of Shaco and into Senna, but getting the build and learning the play style have been some issues that I wanted to resolve. Found out that Luffy pumps his own blood to get stronger but also shortens his own life.
- 7:35pm - Read this interesting article about the `Boot Girls` aka [NPR Boot Girls](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176175801/boot-girls-atlanta-private-parking-enforcement) and its an extremely cool concept! Imagine buying a 3D printer and making unique set of keys that can unlock car boots and then selling them?! It reminds me of the blue ocean and its a great start up besides the ethics involved.
