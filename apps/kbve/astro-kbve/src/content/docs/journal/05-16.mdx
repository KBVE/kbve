### Droid Event System

-   05:19PM

    Now that I got the base of the mutli-worker system setup, the next part would be to setup an event system that the whole library would follow and utilize.
    Instead of placing the event calls and functions everywhere in the code, I think it be wise to create a simple event master singleton that would basically be in charge of handling and processing the events.
    This will live on the main thread and proxy any requests that need to be done.
    For me to do this, I suppose I need to setup a `types/event.d.ts` that would hold all the events information that we plan to use.
    

-   05:51PM

    After adding the basic DroidEventBus and the event types, the next move would be to attach it to the `window.kbve.events`.
    This would make it easier to access and reference outside of the droid eco-system.
    Since we will be doing that, let me update the globals for the library to hold that additional system.
    Damn, there is a race condition that I just can not really resolve with the tools that I have right now, the way that astro page load fires and the way that the workers are loaded, ugh.
    I am going to revert to a simple while loop execution and move on because its just not worth it.

### KBVE Website Migration

-   08:43PM

    One way that we could handle the migration would be just to take the older website code and slap it back into the new site?
    We can keep it there and make sure that the production line is back to normal, granted some of the older modules will still be broken but the site will actually update.
    I am still thinking about the best ways to handle this and I did not want to have some of the older boilerplate but having to rebuild it all will be a pain.

### RareIcon AstroKBVE

-   08:40PM

    Adding a playable RareIcon demo to the KBVE website.
    This is my 3rd attempt at trying to build a solid integration between the React eco-system and the Unity webgl game, hopefully it goes a bit better than last time.
    Majority of this code will be take out and re-used on the rareicon website but that will be for the future.
    For this, I need to install the `react-unity-webgl` package and then setup an `App.jsx` for loading the webgl game and preparing for its execution.
    There is a slight downside, majority of the arcade is still broken and I need to get that resolved.

-    08:57PM

    The multi threaded build was disabled, so I am going to loop back around and update that!
    Making it a bit easier to migrate to worker usage via the react unity library.
    There are a couple more downsides to doing this, the game might not work on itch, so we might have to account for that in the future.
    Yet I want to try and get the game build and operational for the react unity bridge side of things.

### Rancher Memory Usage

-   11:11PM

    There seems to be an issue with the memory and cpu usage within the rancher setup. 
    My educated guess is that there are some hleath checks that are failing and causing a weird ripple and bubble effect, so I will have to switch back over and see what the issue is based upon that.
    I noticed that the health check for the discordsh is wrong, so that needs to be updated too.
    Furthermore, the health checks for the supabase need to be updated too, so that means I will have to set aside some time to just go through each instance and see what the problem might be.

**Python**

The next update to the python library will be to manage the VNC instance directly.
While we wait for the next branch to reach production with the properties file for Runelite, I will start test casing the different click styles and the data movement.

I decided to add a function to stop the runelite client, which follows the same logic as the start function.

Incase I forget, the location to build the Atlas library is `/apps/atlas/` and the command to run the build is `docker build . -t myapp`.
It really is taking a hit to my CPU, this might make development work a bit of a pain as the library grows.

We could offload the integration testing once it gets stable to portainer but even then, there would be such a high usage in resources! Ugh!

After pushing the updated `default.properties` to the runelite outpost, we can pull it within our updated python script and place it where it needs to be.
Current location : `https://kbve.com/data/outpost/runelite/default.properties`

We know that the default profiles would be stored in this location: `~/.runelite/profiles2/` 

When the Runelite loads, it creates a `profiles.json`, which is here: 

```json

{"profiles":[{"id":-1,"name":"$rsprofile","sync":true,"active":false,"rev":-1,"defaultForRsProfiles":[]},{"id":41056315715238,"name":"default","sync":false,"active":true,"rev":-1,"defaultForRsProfiles":[]}]}

```

I need to now download the default.properties from the outpost and then name it `default-41056315715238.properties` , with the id from the profiles.json.

**LoL**

League just did a major update with their patch 14.10!
I am kinda excited for the new items and the return of my old favorites.

**Music**

Going to try to aim at around 30 more songs into the jukebox this week.


**Bullet Train 2022**

Just finished watching the bullet train, it was a solid piece of work!
The storyline ties together very well and I was entertained throughout the whole movie, it gets a solid 8 out of 10 in my review.

## 2023

- 9:00am - When I was taking my mom to her doctor's office, I noticed that they were using a full react-based eco-system! The patients would have tablets, where they would sign forms, fill out and double check their information, schedule and more!
- 12:00pm - Spent some of the time going through the Unity project. I still need to do some updates here and there with some plugins however they might break the game in other areas. I believe test casing or a system to test case the game might have to be on my agenda down the line.
- 2:00pm - Quick workout session , some minor chores, damn laundry! 
- 3:00pm - One Piece, league and programming session aka Memegramming! I am trying to rotate out of Shaco and into Senna, but getting the build and learning the play style have been some issues that I wanted to resolve. Found out that Luffy pumps his own blood to get stronger but also shortens his own life.
- 7:35pm - Read this interesting article about the `Boot Girls` aka [NPR Boot Girls](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1176175801/boot-girls-atlanta-private-parking-enforcement) and its an extremely cool concept! Imagine buying a 3D printer and making unique set of keys that can unlock car boots and then selling them?! It reminds me of the blue ocean and its a great start up besides the ethics involved.
