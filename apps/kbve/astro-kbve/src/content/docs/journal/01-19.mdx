## Notes

## 2025

-   **GoDot**

    06:06AM

        Okay, I am getting the full feel of the rust and godot integration, my focus is a bit split between both games.
        I am torn between wanting to finish the unity game and also learning more about godot.

-   **Snow**

    08:50PM

        I hate cleaning up snow but the night blanket that covers everything looks so peaceful and amazing!
        After recently watching the hateful8, I am really getting that winter vibes.

    09:59PM

        Just came back into the house after doing a quick pre-shovel and my hands feel so frozen.

## 2024

    - 8:00am - `BranchHell`

        #### BranchHell

            There seems to be a bit of a broken branch pipeline!
            This is already an issue and I need to resolve it before I run into more problems.
            I believe the first part of the issue was that I made the CI pipelines before I made the branches.
            The next issue was that I forgot to adjust the rules haha!
            This proves that doing multiple things at once is a bit of a pain, however I will get better at it with more time and skill.

            Now we want to test case the Trunk deployment of the WASM, during the `beta` phase of the build, I believe we should have the action publish the rust wasm embed.
            The process should be simple in that it would run `trunk build --release` within the `apps/rust_wasm_embed`

            After reviewing the nx commands, I think it would be time for me to slowly utilize that executor.
            The `executor` will be the `nx:run-commands` and then the target would be split amoung two different commands.
            The first command will be the `trunksetup` and the second command will be the `trunkdeploy`.
            After getting both of those configured, I will update the `kbve.sh` file to include a `-nx` flag with `rust_wasm_embed:trunksetup` and `rust_wasm_embed:trunkdeploy` to run the commands.
            This way we are still using the `kbve.sh` shell but instead of adding the functions directly into the shell script, we will move them over to nx commands.

    
    - 8:25pm - `Holy`

        #### Holy

            Expanding the crate so that we can the proc-macro_derive -> Observer with the attributes of `holy`.
            My current method of building out the Observer would be to use the `Arc<Mutex<>>` and the basic lock system that would be associated with it.
            I was thinking we could use a lockfree linked list or a BTreeMap, but after some test casing, I am going with a Crossbeam AtomicCell.
            This Atomic cell will help resolve our lock issue when it comes to multi-thread applications and allowing the variables to be accessed without having to unlock.

            So the first part of the Observer function would be similar to this:
                
                ```rust

                        #[proc_macro_derive(Observer, attributes(holy))]
                        pub fn observer_derive(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
                            let ast = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);
                            generate_observer_impl(&ast)
                        }

                ```

                Then moving the impl into its own function!

    -   10:30pm - `Warcraf`

        #### Warcraft

            Ending the night with some Battlegrounds and maybe a quick raid.
            Just did the BFD with a random 10
