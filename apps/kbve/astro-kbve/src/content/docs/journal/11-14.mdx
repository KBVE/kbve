    **useMemory**

    The `useMemory` hook is almost done, but we still need to fix the offscreen integration and maybe even utilize the `useIdleCallback`.
    Let me get this all pushed out and I will enter the testing realm again tonight.

    After making the hook, we can test it out with a profile component?
    The idea would be to create two files for us to use, the general profile container and then a wrapper around that said container for the rendering and caching.
    The first file would be the Profile itself and the second would be a contaijner that would hold the profile and add the useMemory hook around it?

    I am wondering what would be the best way to handle this without causing too many renders but also making it super fast to load and unload profiles.
    I am also thinking that after we get the useMemory hook to work, we can add another hook that would help us create a pool of the objects that we could render offscreen and then transition them in.
    In theory we would be creating one of those infinite scrolling situations but having it render as they scroll through the application.
    The goal would also be to make sure that it does not pull any additional data, by having it cache the results and then use the cache to help build the profiles.
