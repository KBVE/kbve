## 2025

### Astro Web Workers

-   10:12AM

    Rewriting all of the web workers to use dexie and comlink again.
    Tried to roll my own but there was just way too much to account for and to update, so I figured it might make more sense to work with exisiting tooling.

-   07:31PM

    The problem that ended up taking me out, almost burning me out, uhhh was just the damn localStorage!
    I thought the localStorage could be used between the web workers and I was mistaken, it seems that only the indexdb can be.
    That means in the future, I will just stick with building out using Dexie and keep the nanostores as a thin cache layer.

### VSCode Live Share

-   09:42PM

    Its been well past a full day and they are still down!
    I am a bit upset that I can not quad-code without having that full connection but it is fine for now.
    Well the next best thing for me to do is just deskflow amoung all the systems until it comes back up.

## 2024

**Edit**

Another amazing feature of starlight is that we can edit the documents right then and there!

All we had to do was update the starlight configuration and add in this:

```ts

editLink: {
				baseUrl: 'https://github.com/kbve/kbve/edit/dev/apps/kbve.com',
			},

```

**Theory**

After migrating over the applications, the next step would be to add our theory page!
However, I am thinking about the other sections too, but I do not want to get ahead of myself.

Lets us begin the theory migration!


**Discord**

Updated the Discord Page to fit into the new style!

## 2023

**India**

-   The day has been crazy! The heat is a killer. :O

**KBVE**

-   The main focus would be to get the GraphQL to work across the whole KBVE main page and then extend it to various applications.

-   It seems that we will have to use a mixture of GraphQL and REST, as there seems to be some areas where REST is faster.

## Notes

More Updates!
