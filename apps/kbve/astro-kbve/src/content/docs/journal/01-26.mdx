## Notes

    #### keys

        Need to keep track of these keys:
            -   `portainer_stack`
            -   `jwt_secret`
            -   `portainer`
            -   `hcaptcha`
            -   `kbve`
            -   `shieldwall`

## 2025

-   **Pasta**

    10:35AM

        The best way to start the day is to create a nice pot of pasta for the whole day!
        I am using a lentil-based pasta with my four cheese sauce, it hits perfect for lunch and the rest of the day.

-   **ECS**

    11:33PM

        The Bevy ECS will be for the tilemap and I got it to render the basic tiles, yet the placement of them is still a bit off.
        I am going to spend a bit too much time trying to resolve it but I think it will be worth it for the future.

-   **UI**

    12:55PM

        The UI/UX Godot extension will need a couple updates, one is a better menu system and the other will be a couple message canvas.
        One of the first ones that I want to add is a visual novel style canvas that will load a background image, an avatar and some kind of animation for the text to be displayed.

## 2024

    -   7:00am  -   `Bear`

        #### Bear

            Decided to start a TV series for my morning binge and since I enjoyed Shameless, I figured I would give FX's show a shot.
            Ended up watching almost all of the first season in one sitting, it was definitely on point and worth a watch.
            In between the the first couple episodes, I had to make a quick trip to Wawa and grab myself a steak and egg hoggie.


    -   10:30am -   `SQL`

        #### SQL
        
            The primary key will be shifted back to the BigInt via the Serial.
            `SERIAL is an alias for BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE.`
            Given that the global table is still using the serial, I will just go back and basically replicate that.
            
            Next it would be preparing the different tables that the `kbve` package will need to include doing the refactor.

            The message table would look like this:

                ```javascript

                            export const message = mysqlTable('message', {
                                id: serial('id').primaryKey().notNull(),
                                sender_id: binary('sender_id', { length: 16 }).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
                                receiver_id: binary('receiver_id', { length: 16 }).references(() => users.userid).notNull(),
                                content: text('content').notNull(),
                                sent_at: timestamp('sent_at', { mode: 'string' }).notNull().defaultNow(),
                            }, (table) => {
                                return {
                                    sender_id_idx: uniqueIndex("sender_id_idx").on(table.sender_id),
                                    receiver_id_idx: uniqueIndex("receiver_id_idx").on(table.receiver_id)
                                };
                            });

                ```

            However there should be some additional fields that we might want to add.

            Wait I forgot an additional change that I need to do for the schema, which is change the length of the fields from 256 to 255.

            Okay after deploying the new tables, I forgot to double check the global keys that we would need, so I might have to create a tool to keep track of those.
