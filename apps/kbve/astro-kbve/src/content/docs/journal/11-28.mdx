    **GameServer**

    I am keeping track of the gameserver stats, which comes with some great surprises!
    Our current gameserver is a 4mb docker build with about 2.7mb ram usage!
    I think that has been my best build so far this year, really excited about it as well.
    Yet I think there are some issues with the helm chart and the UDP access, but I think I can figure it out.

    **Nightly**

    Still working through the code to help me get a better understanding, but there are so many weird issues that I run into.
    I am still a bit lost in the process of the websockets but I think that might be just a lack of experience?

    **CI**

    It looks like we are having some CI build problems and I am not too sure if its from the `SuperTiled` pack or not?
    Maybe what we can do is disable that package or change the image for which the ci-alpha is building from?
    Going to drop the `ubuntu-latest` to `ubuntu-20.04` and see if that can solve that problem.

    **Deployment**

    We might have to restructure the deployment, keeping track of what we need for the helm deployment.
    The fleet deployment information is as follows:

    Repo: `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git`
    Branch : `dev`
    Paths: `/migrations/kube/charts/rareicon`

    These are all that are needed before we move forward with the helm deployment.
    Let me go ahead and deploy this out now before my next match.
