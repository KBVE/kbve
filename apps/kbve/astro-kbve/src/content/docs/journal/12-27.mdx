### AWS Barman

-   11:00PM

    Resolved the massive space usage that our postgres backup was holding.
    The AWS bill has dropped back down to under $1 for what we have, but there is still some room for improvements.

    **Laptop**

    For some reason, Fedex did not get a chance to deliver the laptop?
    I did not hear the door bell but now that I am thinking about it, it could have been because of the power that runs to the doorbell being off.
    I will look into that later tonight.

    **Sleep**

    Ugh, so tired and hungover, I might just go back to sleep again and refresh my mind.
    I got a bunch of peter and bald playing in the background, while I am taking a quick mental break.
