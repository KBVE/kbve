## Notes

## 2025

### Player2DNode

-   08:21AM

    Time to take a step back, refresh the mind and rewrite the way that we are handling the player node.
    We need to make sure that the sprites are there, thus have to create a 2D Resource Cache for the Sprite2D as well.
    I will take care of that first, I suppose.

-   08:45AM

    Okay so the Sprite2d would not be in the cache and then treat each NPC as unique objects that then stay within a hashmap + vector.
    Active NPCs/Entity will stay in the Vec and inactive will go back into the hashmap.
    Renaming the `player2dnode` to `playerentity`, which we can then build out as a future proof for multiplayer as well.
    Then instead of a `player_manager`, we can do an entity manager, which will hold both the players and the NPCs that they will interact with.
    This should be an easy thing to build out, afterwards we can go back and adjust the hexgrid manager / ecs situation because we will have a better way to keep track of positions.



## 2024

### Transition

A huge chunk of my time was spent setting up the transitional views within Astro!
I was finally able to get a better understanding of javascript, global variables and the esm-style importing.
However the amount of time it takes to get everything to be functional and making sure that nothing bugs out, ugh, its rough.
My suggestion for a system like this would be to utilize a 3rd party script or entity like Partytown to help shift a lot of the javascript to a webworker or service Worker, because it would help resolve a decent amount of issues that are involved with switching from DOM to DOM.


### FishChip

The next stage in jam would be to maybe start fresh and with a clean state, since we got to understand a decent more about how the Phaser engine works.
I needed to take a break from the Unity game engine and this was the perfect mixture, because I know I have a huge amount of UI/UX that I need to use javascript for within Unity.

The new build process for the fish & chip game will be under the `apps/react-phaser-fish-chip`.

We will be using vite to build the react, phaser and any additional packages.
The command to run the application is `pnpm nx serve react-phaser-fish-chip` for now, what I will most likely do is setup the pipeline so that it pushes the dist files to `kbve.com` repo.


### Unity

I have to make sure the Unity changes are still in sync with the Azure Devops, which involves a couple different test cases and pipeline changes.
One of the major pipeline change will be to shift the build process out to Github self-hosted containers, yet the plot twist is that they will have to pull the data from the Azure LFS.
Sometimes I forgot how much I just enjoy making video games, rather than spending so much time putting it all together.
