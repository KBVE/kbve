## 2024

**Atlas**

After establishing the API, the next step was building out the plugin system and the different ways we can utilize python.

**Music**
I am currently going through about 300 new songs that I need to add into the jukebox.
The greatest part of preparing the next batch of music is that it feels like going through a time machine, when I first listen to chillstep to how I slowly migrated to lofi hiphop.

The real hack is to create a secondary youtube account where you just listen to a bunch of music that you like and then the algo find more songs that are related!
My playlist is filled with new music that I have to listen through each day xD

## 2023

- 1:00pm - All those late nights and lack of sleep has caught up, I am in such a daze. The first thing I might have to do is to double check my server's networking. We spent a decent amount of the late night / early morning going over the different types of networking. The idea was to give local IP addresses to LXC containers but had a bit of a tough time doing so. The big risk with Networking is that it is super confusing unless you have experience and get an understanding of what is actually happening. I honestly rather just let existing software handle this for me, as I consider it all black magic.
- 4:45pm - Going to sync this repo before I begin to update the whole website to a new theme. The new theme is part of the plan of getting all of KBVE up to date across the board, ideally towards something greater! 
- 7:15pm - I am going to go over a couple popular dashboard themes and see if I can replicate some of their unique functions into the current build of `kbve.com`. I noticed that I do not have the best eslint standards and maybe I should look into addressing those issues and see if I can improve my current setup.
