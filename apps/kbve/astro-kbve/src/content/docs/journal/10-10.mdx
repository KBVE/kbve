import { Adsense, Tasks } from '@kbve/astropad';

## 2024

**KiloNet**

The GameManager, JSON utils, event system, ect... all of these things can be refactored and rewritten into its own nuget library that we can package up and release.
My goal would be to isolate this part of the codebase from any game that we build, almost making it agnostic and version controlled?
This was something that I wanted to practice and have under my toolbelt as a skill, furthermore, it will make things like FFI in the future easier to implement and even backtrace.

This is another grand task to take on but I am confident that it will be a huge mess, uhh I meant overengineered alien crash landing.
To get started, we will have to tell our dotnet to generate the starter library, then begin stripping out the older code from `unity-rareicon` and `saber`.
Once we get all these things handled, we can then publish this nuget library and import it into the rare icon on the Azure Git Repo.

Okay, getting started with this library / package, to generate it, we will run this command:

```shell

nx g @nx-dotnet/core:lib kilonet --directory=kilonet

```

This will generate our base library that we can import in our various projects.

To import this library in our unity, we will do this:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.kbve.kilonet": "https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git?path=/packages/kilonet#dev"
  }
}
```

We place the dependency to a specific folder, `/packages/kilonet` and then assign the branch with the hash flag, `#dev`.

This way we can pull the code and test it from the dev branch.


**ParaOps**

At the same time we are building this, I want to adjust some of the broken codebase too.
We need to finish adding the itch page to fix the 404 error that was showing up ealier.
One of the larger problems that I need to address was the broken itch io for Fish and Chip!
We updated the astro component and added our own custom phaser component inside of the `kbve.com`, avoiding the `ve` import from astro-ve.
This was an issue with over engineering and this method will help resolve that problem, with the game playable now without any major issues, I believe.
Let us solve the 404 error first and then we can wrap back around with better CSS fix, which will be easier once we can see the game load on itch.
