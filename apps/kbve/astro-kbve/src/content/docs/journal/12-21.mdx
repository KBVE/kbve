    **Kanban**

    Updating the kanban policies and preparing the jsonb atomic updates.
    A part of me wants to just run the whole websockets for the application through rust and our own custom ingress.

    **Cold**

    The weather is brick cold, I am just getting way too sleepy and can not handle this lack of heat!
    The 4090s should be spinning up some heat but I been too lazy to go handle that situation either.

    **Knocked**

    I tried to stay up for the unity meeting but I am way too tired and I think I am about to ass out.
