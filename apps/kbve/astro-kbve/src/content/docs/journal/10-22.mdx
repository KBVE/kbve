## 2024

**hCaptcha**

Yesterday we were able to get the captcah to work on mobile but not web, then we got it to work on web but not on mobile.
The growing pains were felt at each inch of my nerves, yet this is part of the learning experience.
I spent some time refactoring and looking into why it was an issue, I am not too sure why the solution works but it does.
I am a bit scared that this solution will fall apart in the near future because these captchas are becoming more and more painful.

**VanillaJS**

On the flipside, I am thinking of building an extremely simple javascript file, one that is just straight vanillaJS that would help integrate some of the basics of the supabase.
The idea here would be to help some newer users get used to Supabase and help them understand the core ideas behind it.

**Sheet**

There were some issues with the sheet but I am going to tackle them right now.
I believe that there are two ways we can solve the sheet problem, the first would be to adjust the way that we call it.
The sheet should have a model, at least that is what the example docs are using and that would make sense.

The other would be to update the tamagui to version v1.116, which looks like it includes fixes to their sheet.
Both make sense and it would be wise that we just do both of them anyhow.

Okay! What a wild trip of fixing all the links and modifications.
We had to drop some of the versions of react native packages, at least so that they would match the tamagui version that we are using.
With that being said, we were able to get the mobile and the web application running without any issue, but damn the sheet is still not working.

**Rust**

For the next rust application, we will try and deploy it through flyio too.
Its going to be a basic key&value database but one that we can call from any endpoint, as long as they have an api key.
This would be like a pastebin type setup but for almost anyone to use , hmm, I might even integrate it with some of the AWS services or maybe add some abstraction layers to it.
Anyhow, I am going to keep this here as a quick note so that I can reference it back later on.

**RSPS**

The journey continues in the adventures of the good old rsps scene, but this time around, I am looking at finally running the dream within its own wrapped docker image.
This would be something that we can deploy through our kubernetes and make it very easy to control through supabase, basically allowing us to launch our PaaS down the line by swapping out the docker image that we would want to run.
There are a couple of moving pieces that we still need to note down but that will come with time.
