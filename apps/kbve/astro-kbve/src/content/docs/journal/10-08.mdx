### Clickhouse Bi Directional

-   05:35PM

    The goal will be to setup a direct wire between the cnpg and clickhouse cluster!
    Well specifically we want the ability for the the FDW on the postgres to not only read but write to the cluster, and obviously the same from the clickhouse side.
    However we will have to make sure that the data stored in the clickhouse is shared across the replicas, so we do not waste too much of the resources by keeping multiple copies in ram.
    This still requires some work on our end to setup without breaking anything.

### Landing Card Starlight

-   07:59PM

    Finishing up the basic landing card for KBVE, having it utilize the starlight theme and also the virutalized list.
    There are a couple other bugs with the card that we need to resolve, I believe the issue that has been hitting us hard is the this damn margin top that keeps appearing!
    It just ends up offsetting every element by a specific amount and I just can not seem to figure it out.
    Richie came in clutch with that fix, we can move forward with some of the other parts of the code that we need to adjust.

**Auth**

Back to focusing on the paraops, getting the base of the unity auth built out, so that that it can help with the user sign in.
We can also place some safety measures around the unity auth, so that if `window.Vuplex` is not found, it would not send the postmessage with the JWT?
I still have to work around the exact way that we could handle this, but I do want to get it all done by tonight.

**Steam Pipeline**

While building out the rest of the auth system, I want to go back and restructure the github actions yaml for building the unity game's pipeline.

**CI Patch**

The `ci-patch` workflow started to fail and it might be because of package conflicts between the main monorepo and the current dependencies under the `@kbve/devops`.
Thus to address this, we will have to find a couple different routes!
The most likely reason we are having this issue is because the `deps` between the package and the monorepo are outdated.
This will be something that I can address but lets see if we can isolate that issue?
I am going to move the action out of the `monorepo` and into its own independant folder.
