## Notes


## 2025

### Yemen War Leaks

-   08:50PM

    The leaks for the battleplans within Yemen are really crazy to think about?
    Sending an order to bomb a city while just casually browsing the phone is just peak dystopia.


### Upgraded

-   11:50PM

    This movie is still living rent free, almost like if GPT were to take over a human mind.
    Having the co pilot try to autofill this journal entry... makes it even worse xD.
    All of this should be a future quest in RentEarth.

### Actions

Time to test case the LC Agents Expo deployment using Github Actions.
There will be three main test cases that we will perform, the first would be for the web, then Android and finally iOS.

Instead of bulking up the main `deployment`, I am thinking that it would be wise to start splitting up the actions a bit. 
However I am thinking before I add new action files for each deployment, I will at least try to keep them within the same `ci-main` for now.

```yaml

    lc-agents-expo-deployment:
        needs: ["alter", "deploy"]
        name: Build Expo Web LC Agents
        if: needs.alter.outputs.lcagents == 'true'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            contents: read
            packages: write
        steps:
            - name: Checkout Repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v4

            - name: Setup Node v18
              uses: actions/setup-node@v3
              with:
                node-version: 18
            
            - name: Setup pnpm
              uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
              with:
                version: 8
                run_install: false

            - name: Get pnpm Store Path
              shell: bash
              run: |
                    echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path --silent)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

            - name: Setup pnpm Cache
              uses: actions/cache@v3
              with:
                path: ${{ env.STORE_PATH }}
                key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
                restore-keys: |
                    ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-store-
            
            - name: Install pnpm dependencies
              run: pnpm install

```

That is the base of the action that we will be using to setup the `pnpm` before we execute any expo commands.

Okay now we have to work out the build phase, which is below:

```yaml
           # -   name: LCA Expo Build

            -   name: LCA Expo Build
                uses: ./.github/actions/kbve-shell
                with:
                    flag: '-nx expo-lcagents:export'
                    create_pull_request: false
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

            
            -   name: LC Agents -> Deployment
                uses: dobbelina/copy_file_to_another_repo_action@main
                env:
                    API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.UNITY_PAT }}
                with:
                    source_file: 'dist/apps/expo-lcagents/'
                    destination_repo: 'kbve/lc-agents.com'
                    destination_folder: '/docs'
                    destination_branch: 'main'
                    destination_branch_create: 'patch-kbve-lcagents-deploy'
                    user_email: '5599058+h0lybyte@users.noreply.github.com'
                    user_name: 'h0lybyte'
                    commit_message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
                    rsync_option: "-avrh --delete"
        
    ```
