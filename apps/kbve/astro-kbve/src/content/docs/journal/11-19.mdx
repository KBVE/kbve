    Time to start building out the netcode for the unity code.
    `NetworkObjectManager`, `NetworkObject` and `SyncTransform`.
    Well we would also need another library that would generate the ULIDs?
    Okay, lets start with that and then build around it all later on.

    To kepe things simple enough, we will call this the `ULIDHelper` and then call that into the Unity game.
    This helper will be focused on async ulid generation, hopefully not from the main thread either.

    **ULIDHelper**

    Okay going to push the first helper out and then see if the unity project accepts it without giving me errors.
    If everything goes as planned, then I will loop back around and see if I can add more files to help with the networking.
