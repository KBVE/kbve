    **Kilobase**

    During the migration process, we made a small mistake with the longhorn and now have to redeploy the database.
    I am going to take that time to see if there are any updates that we need to do as well.

-   03:20AM

    **PvC**
    
    We got a couple persistent volume claims that are stuck in a weird loop, where we are not too sure if they can be found or not.
    To help debug this porblem, we will be running these two commands:

    ```shell
    kubectl describe pvc pvc-1696b3cc-da05-4753-872c-f88f13e20d0a
    kubectl get pv | grep pvc-1696b3cc-da05-4753-872c-f88f13e20d0a
    ```

    Then it returns this:

    ```
    Error from server (NotFound): persistentvolumeclaims "pvc-1696b3cc-da05-4753-872c-f88f13e20d0a" not found
    8Gi        RWO            Delete           Terminating   armada/redis-data-redis-master-0                 longhorn       <unset>                          86d
    ```

    To grab the location for it, we went ahead and did this:

    ```shell
    kubectl edit pv pvc-1696b3cc-da05-4753-872c-f88f13e20d0a
    ```

    This will allow us to make a couple quick edits to the `finalizers` that hold that pvc.
    In this first case we want to just remove the redis data block, so we will strip out the finalizers holding it.
    Then do this:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pv pvc-1696b3cc-da05-4753-872c-f88f13e20d0a --grace-period=0 --force
    ```

    We need to locate them inside of our longhorn.

    ```

    orphan-7bc0707b775aae99dc1927e76ac1677839a2ef7eacbb6509014aafe5cc81c77e
    ```

    The next option might be just best to just delete the deployment and start again?

    Okay we know the redis sits in the `armada-naval`, so we will go ahead and rebuild it from there.
    The first step will be the name, which is going to be `armada-naval` and it will deploy to the `armada` namespace.
    The repository url will be `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git` and the branch will be `dev`.
    Afterwards, we want to enable the self healing and set the paths to `/migrations/kube/charts/armada`. Hmm, there is another option to keep resources but we can let longhorn handle that for us.
    While that gets pushed up and prepares to build itself out, we can shift over to the AWS and prepare for the Kilobase launch.

    **Kilobase**

    Time to bring the kilobase back around but with more updates and minor fixes as well.
    We need to pull the s3 backup and do the cluster auto-migration / repair but I did want to deploy a new instance of kilobase, hmm.
    I will hold off on that rust adaption for now, too many problems can be an issue for us.
    Same as before but we will swap out the `/migrations/kube/charts/kilobase` path.

    **Realtime**

    Now I want to focus on getting the realtime supabase to work, hopefully without having too many errors in this process.

    **Redis**

    After getting the long horn and size situation resolved, we will be moving forward with the redis deployment.
    The goal of the redis deployment is to just get a better understanding of how it will work in our eco-system.
    Let me push up the phase zero of the deployment and see where it will go from there.
    Under Armada, I am going to have to add another deployment change.
