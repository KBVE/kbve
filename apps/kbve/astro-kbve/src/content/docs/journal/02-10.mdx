## Notes

## 2025

### Main

-   02:53AM

    During the migration of the subfolders, it seems that the build locations have also shifted a tadbit.
    This means that I will have to double check each execution within all the ci pipeline yamls.
    I believe the `dist` will now be under the `apps` but we shall see during the next main build. 

### Migrations Nx SubFolders

-   03:49AM

    Next batch of migrations!
    Moving CityVote into its own repo, then adding the deprecated folder.

```shell
pnpm nx g move --project expo-cityvote --destination apps/cityvote/expo-cityvote --skipFormat=true
```

-   06:05AM

    Migrating `rust_godot` to rentearth subfolder.

```shell
pnpm nx g move --project rust_godot_towerdefense --destination apps/rentearth/rust_godot_towerdefense --skipFormat=true
```

-   05:44PM

    Finishing the cryptothrone migration, now we need to add the `deprecated` folder, for apps that we need to remove.
    Later on, I will go back in and make adjustments to them.
    Next, we can move the pydiscord into the discord sub folder, furthermore, we can add the front end into that folder too.

```shell
pnpm nx g move --project rust_p16_gameserver --destination apps/experimental/rust_p16_gameserver --skipFormat=true
pnpm nx g move --project expo-lcagents --destination apps/experimental/expo-lcagents --skipFormat=true
pnpm nx g move --project expo-hqplan --destination apps/experimental/expo-hqplan --skipFormat=true
pnpm nx g move --project rust_wasm_embed --destination apps/experimental/rust_wasm_embed --skipFormat=true

```


## 2024

#### Astro

Going to take a quick break from Unity and work on the AstroVE backlog!
There are a couple components that I was missing, which I need to add, migrate and test case.
I wanted to isolate some of the basic game engine from YoRHa proof of concept and turn it into an AstroVE component.
Furthermore, I wanted to migrate over the visual novel codebase and turn that into another AstroVE component.
Finally, the biggest problem that I would have to resolve is the KBVE.com launch under the mono-repo, which is going to be a pain.



#### Bevy

While I am working on the website, I am also reading up on the bevy game engine and its integration with the egui.
My plan is to eventually move away from Unity and venture into bevy, but given that bevy is still under active development and not at a stable release, it would make sense to limit my exposure.
