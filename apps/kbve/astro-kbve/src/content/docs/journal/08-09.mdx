## 2024

**MapDB**
The first map that we will be building for the initial main city will be around `1000x1000` large and it will be used as the main city of operations.
Let me save the map with the expanded tileset and then I will try to fill it up with as much content as I can.
Okay, we were able to get the base grid and map done, I was able to figure out that `ge_collide` was the variable that was being used to determine if a certain tile has collision.
However, I was not able to test out the different height or elevations when it comes to the tile mapping, but for now I can skip it.

**MadMax**
Decided to spend some time watching all of the mad max series!
The world building for it is great and we should definitely look at making one or two maps based upon the series, grabbing a bit of the lore too.

**Notes**
I am thinking that we could move the notes into the frontmatter for the future reference and then have a script handle the editing of the notes?
This means we would be moving the `notes` and `tasks` into the top part of the frontmatter.

**Proxmox Migration**
Moving the last instance of a local proxmox into the next v8.
These are changes that we need to make within this next couple weeks, then I will have to make sure its moved up faster.

## 2023

- 12:15am - I should get ready to sleep! Going to spend the early morning setting up Supabase and migrating the tri-force to near perfection.
- 6:24am - SSS Completed. It took some time for my system to boot up because of a Windows update B0UT I am all cylinders ready to go! The first couple course of actions would be to setup the Redis cache system, so that we are not hitting the database too hard with our queries. 
- 7:35am - The n8n and Supabase integration will start with the general profile, I should expand it out slowly as I get more information and time to work with it.

## Quote

> Everyone in the world ought to do the things for which he is specially adapted. It is the part of wisdom to recognize what each one of us is best fitted for, and it is the part of education to perfect and utilize such predispositions. Because education can direct and aid nature but can never transform her.
