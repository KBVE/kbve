### StarYO Kube

-   10:05AM

    Preparing the kube deployment of staryo.

### Unity Session

-   10:00PM

    The whole session went great, we were able to resolve some of the FPS issues and now only some minor core jobs are left for us to resolve.
    I should not say that they are minor job fixes but basically we are making our own cache layer ontop of the ECS that unity provides.

    **TSLA**

    The run up past $300 is a huge problem for me!
    I am going to have to find a way to postpone the sell off of my 5 contracts, going to roll it into next week at 305 strike.
    Hopefully the post trump era stock cools off next week but this is a dangerous rally, it can easily skip to $400 without me even looking.

    **CryptoThrone**

    More updates to the crypto throne, including changing the tileset.
    We might have to go with a new way of handling the tilesets, I think if we switch out of the static and go with a dynamic?
    The map chunking is still broken and I am not too sure if I will be able to fix.
    Maybe instead of having the chunking done during the loading state, I might have to pre-chunk them ahead of time.
    Looking through the different examples, it seems that people use build tools to make a custom json chunkset of the map, which makes sense because javascript is not too powerful.
