## Notes

## 2025

-   **Supabase**

    01:00AM

        The next major update should be ready by tomorrow, we want to keep the turso integration but also slowly build out the migration to the postgres.
        While that is going on, I want to start the front end of the discordsh server.
        The question remains if we want to use NextJS or Astro, hmm, both are already included in the monorepo but I am thinking that astro with shadcn would be a better move than material design and nextjs.
    
    01:34AM

        We want to include the `Constraints` for the `discord_servers` table, even though we already have them in the python code.
        This is just a double check for the sake of data integrity!
        Starting with the `invite` column, this is what I am thinking we will include.
        
```sql
CONSTRAINT ck_valid_invite_code CHECK (invite ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9-]{2,100}$')
```

        Next column that we want to limit is the `name`.
        Actually, while looking at the `name` field, I believe it would make more sense to just drop the `TEXT` field and use a `varchar` field instead!
        We should limit it to about 100 characters, to be safe, we will do 101 characters.
        The `name` field will then be 101.

```sql

name VARCHAR(101) NOT NULL,

CONSTRAINT ck_name_combined CHECK (
        name ~ '^[\p{L}\p{N} _-]{2,100}$'
    ),

```

        Okay the name was replaced from TEXT field to the varchar field and we added a basic check against common attack vectors.
        Granted we will not be letting the server owner directly edit the table through the RPC or supabase's api client.
        The plan is still to use the python server as a medium of handling the `discord_server` data.

        Okay, that field is out of the way, the next field will be `summary` and we will follow the same logic.
        Dropping the `TEXT` and using a `VARCHAR` instead.

```sql

summary VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,

CONSTRAINT ck_summary_combined CHECK (
    summary ~ '^[\p{L}\p{N} _\-,.!?]{2,200}$'
)

```
        That will handle the summary issue for our use case!
        Okay quickly added description and website as well.
        Both need an additional sanitization before they get added into the table but we will handle that from the python side.

-   **FastAPI**

    The next move would be to see if we can get the SQLModels to work with the Supabase API.


### 2024

    -   4:40pm  - `outpost`

        #### outpost

            These are just some small notes for the outpost.
            This issue ticket will keep track of it: [503](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/503)
            So under the Nx Outpost, I could add the automated report to that folder.
            In addition, I could also test case some PDF processing, converting it over to a MD/MDX using Ollama.
            During the folder creations for the outpost, I will throw in a `.gitkeep` to help keep track of the folders.
            Furthermore, I believe I should include a MD file that we could test case under the `egui`, I would want to pull that file and see if it can be rendered.
            
    -   5:26pm  -   `migration`

        #### migration

            Going to tackle the [502](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/502) issue right now because it would be related to the 503.
            I will create a new folder under `/data/` for scripts!

            Okay so for the outpost scripts, we will place them under `/tools/scripts/public` , which is a symbolic link to `/apps/kbve.com/public/data/scripts`.
            For organization, we will call this the `/outpost/nx/` and the script name will be `report.sh`.

            Actually I am thinking of just using the `./kbve.sh` shell file as the base for creating the report file.
            I believe I would need to also build out a base template for the markdown files.
            Thus, under the `/data/` folder, I will go ahead and create a `mdx` folder, where I will store the templates for the time being.

            As I am currently test casing the report script, here is the command to run it, as of right now.

                ```shell

                    ./kbve.sh -createmarkdown report ./apps/kbve.com/public/data/outpost/nx/report.mdx

                ```

            This command would create the `report.mdx` as a file in the outpost location.
