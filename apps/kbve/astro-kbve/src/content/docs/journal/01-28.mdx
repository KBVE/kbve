## 2026

### OSRS Items

-   04:11PM

    Making changes to the OSRS items and hopefuly we some really good graph design

## 2025

-   **Godot**

    11:07AM

        The UX/UI extension has been taking a bit too much of my time trying to figure out how to adjust the text display.
        One of the issues that I am having is trying to balance the text appearing and not getting in a way of the avatar.

    01:49PM
    
        A WSL command would make sense to add, where it then runs the build for windows, wasm and linux.
        Then we can add a m1 build that does mac, wasm and linux?! Hmm, going to keep notes on this for future reference.

        It would look something like this:

```json

  "build-wsl": {
    "executor": "nx:run-commands",
    "options": {
      "commands": [
        "pnpm nx run rust_godot_towerdefense:build-linux",
        "pnpm nx run rust_godot_towerdefense:build-windows",
        "pnpm nx run rust_godot_towerdefense:build-wasm"
      ],
      "parallel": false
    }
  },
```
        This would then run all three for us , making it a bit eaiser via this shell command:

```shell

./kbve.sh -nx rust_godot_towerdefense:build-wsl

```

-   **Menu**

    02:17PM

        The menu system will be expanded later today to include some custom shaders.
        

## 2024

    -   9:53am  -   `Refactor`

        #### Refactor

            The `kbve` package has a couple errors that needs to be addressed, which are mainly because the user table has `userid` now instead of `ulid` as a reference.
            
            Issue one would be under the `guild.rs` but now how should I refactor it? 

            For now I am just updating the references to the `ulid` table as `userid`, since we want to make sure the column names match for the inner/left joins.

            However during the `cargo test`, I noticed the holy crate was broken too, which means I need to go back and fix that as well xD!

            The issue with the holy crate would be the observers, which I have addressed.

            Going back to the `kbve` package and `rust_wasm_embed`, I reset the `hcaptcha` key within the database and we are running into some verification issues.

            To help resolve this, I am going to pull the dev server replication from `5` units to `1` and see what the problem is when it comes to the verification, which is most likely something stupid hehe.

            
            The goal right now would be to isolate the different functions of the package into their own files, then slowly extend out each one of them.
            I want to do this slowly but I will skip the integration testing and stack tracing until the base of the refactor is done.

        
        #### Captcha

            This was a pain to figure out because I could not tell if I was having errors from the HCaptcha service, itself, or if there was just something wrong with the docker network.
            In the end, I was able to register my test account, which is enough to move forward with the rest of the refactor.

            The current struct for HCaptcha looks like this:

                ```rust
                
                    #[derive(Deserialize)]
                    struct HCaptchaResponse {
                        success: bool,
                        challenge_ts: Option<String>, // Timestamp of the challenge
                        hostname: Option<String>, // Hostname of the site
                        credit: Option<bool>, // Deprecated field
                        #[serde(rename = "error-codes")]
                        error_codes: Option<Vec<String>>, // Error codes, if any
                    }

                ```

                The `error_codes` or `error-codes` should pass through the json but I can come back to that at a later time.

        #### Checks

            The `health_check` and `speed_test` utility functions will be migrated into one route that we will call system diagnostics.
            This route will contain all the information we would need to debug, examine and test the live instance.

            In the integration test case, I am calling them like this:

                ```rust
                                
                    .route("/health", get(kbve::routes::system_health_check))
                    .route("/speed", get(kbve::routes::system_database_speed_test))

                ```

            Both of the routes are working fine without any issues at the local point, I will save the progress at this route.
