## 2024

**Docker**

Updated the Docker notes and added some quick tables.
I believe make a tool that could generate simple docker scripts and maybe one that can help build docker composes would be great!
This would a bit of complex tool to build right this second, but I will start mapping it out once I get a better feeling for python.

Okay! Added the github action to build atlas, which should execute on the `main` push.

With the `atlas` being released under this [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbve/atlas)


**GUI**

The next part of our adventure will be to be to connect our WASM build to our docker image!
There are a couple ways that I am thinking of handling this, we could have the python script display a small box that shows the internal server is running.

Wait we can just drop the GUI! I just got the perfect idea, we could just have the default application open chrome and load our website.
This way we can just have our website host our front facing application?

Hmm, let me see if I can setup a quick test case for it.

We want the image to talk to atlas directly without having any issues, hmm, maybe we have it go to the dashboard upon loading?

While the main branch is building, I wonder if we could extend out some example buttons to provide for Atlas.
Actually, while the Atlas loads the dashboard, we could pass somthing through the url?



## 2023

- 9:00am - Getting ready for the markets to open and going to sell some weekly calls. I am currently looking to get rid of my [$SPY](https://kbve.com/stock/spy) at $415 and a couple hundred TSLA for around $200 this week. The premium for it all was around $1000 that I will collect for this trade, which I do not need right now, so I am going to put them all into $O, which ended up being around 16 shares. Those 16 shares will now make about $4.08? a month in dividends and if I include the cover on the $[O](https://kbve.com/stock/o) shares, then its closer to around $4.25 a month. My goal for this year is to get $O to make around $1000 a month in dividends, afterwards I will try to get $[STAG](https://kbve.com/stock/stag) past $1000 a month in dividends. 
- 11:00am - I am currently rebuilding the [Portainer](https://kbve.com/application/portainer/) eco-system and having all my laptops and desktops connected to its edge system. The goal will then be to deploy web scrappers onto those edge containers as a test case.
- 12:00pm - I had to rewrite the City Vote scrapper a couple times to get the hang of constructors, specifically those that operate within the scope of A sync inside of JavaScript. I am a bit rough in the Nodejs department, so I think its time to do some practices.
- 4:00pm - Looks like my $SPY are going to get assigned today for $415 a share, which is fine because I will then write a $415 put and collect another premium tomorrow.
- 5:00pm - My docker eco-system on Windows has been running issues after a recent update and it seems to be because I also had rancher desktop installed. The rancher desktop had changed my default WSL settings to its own ubuntu instance, which had caused issues when docker was looking for its own instance. The solution was to remove rancher and all instances of WSL, then re-install [docker](https://kbve.com/application/docker) again.
- 6:00pm - It looks like coolify does not automatically deploy the newest updates, thus I will have to find a way to setup an automated deployment or see if there is a custom plugin out there that could do it for me. 
- 9:00pm - Taking a break, playing some league and watching Barry! The final season of the show is amazing, the plot thickens and overall its been an amazing show. NoNo Hank has been absolutely brilliant!
