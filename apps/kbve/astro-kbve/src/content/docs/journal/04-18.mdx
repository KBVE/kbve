## 2025

### RareIcon Title

-   06:37AM

    Updating the title scene for rareicon game, as it was something that was long over due and I been too lazy to finish it.
    Going to get into the habit of triggering more builds and updates, since they take 30 mins to finish up.

### Ubuntu 20 LTS

-   07:38AM

    I missed the memo that Ubuntu 20 LTS runners are no longer on github actions!
    That means I will have to update the CI Runners.

-   01:33PM

    The runner was updated, preparing another test build.

## 2024

**Homepage**

I am getting a bit more comfortable with the framer motion and how the animations would work!
But damnm does setting up the whole homepage feel like a pain, getting the perfect website for KBVE will be always a passion project.

**Python**

The split in the dockerfile, we will put the v01d configuration within the `migrations/docker/v01d/` folder and should use the github actions to build a docker image for `v01d`.
After building that Image, we can go back to the python build and pull it as a base?

Under the `Dockerfile` for the `v01d`, we will use this as the base template:

```docker

### Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the base image
FROM ubuntu:22.04
### Interactive Shell must be disabled.
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
### Apt-Get Install
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    wget \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    x11vnc \
    dbus-x11 \
    xvfb \
    xauth \
    tightvncserver \
    novnc \
    net-tools \
    python3-tk \
    python3-dev \
    gnupg2 \
    gnome-terminal \
    gnome-session

# Install Python and Poetry using deadsnakes PPA
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-distutils python3-pip && \
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3.12 -

# Environment variables to configure
ENV HOME=/root \
    DISPLAY=:1 \
    XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority

# Ensure the Poetry bin directory is in the PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:${PATH}"

# Updating NodeJS to v21.
RUN curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_21.x | sudo -E bash - && \
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```

This should give us the noVnc, node 21 and python 3.12!

We are getting the node 21 from [nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#ubuntu-versions), which I should add into the NodeJS documents.

I should then update the `main` action to build this image and upload it to the dockerhub.

The next push forward should help resolve the build issue with this entry.

## 2023

**India**

-   Went to the hospital for my yearly check up and it was an interesting system. So I pay around 1000R and get a "full body" checkup, from almost every major medical branch. It was a bit time consuming, about less than 2 hours in total but it was definitely better than having to schedule a bunch of different doctors. Furthermore, since they all work in the same hospital, they could give secondary reviews and be able to cross-pin among different areas of a concern. I will try to make a quick reference about this for anyone that might want to do medical tourism within Gujarat, India.

-   After the hopsital trip, I did a casual photo shoot at Sonia Studio and it was magical. First time experiencing the depth that a photographer goes to get the best shot of a person, besides just the angles, lights and timing. Will I ever want to do modeling again in the future? Nah. Was it fun? Yup and for many other reasons as well.

-   Now its about 1pm and I decided to meet up with a local and chill at his work. He basically runs a safety & maintainece company for a buddy of his

## Notes

We will have to update the journal entries and the way that they look.
