## 2025

### v1.7.1 Notification Bot

-   12:26AM

    The plan is to just get the basics out of the way and maybe include a way to have it automatically clear up the embed for the bot.
    There should be a way to keep track of that message that gets created in the thread, but hmm.
    I am doing everything I can to avoid having to keep creating and destroying damn tables, its just seems like that its too much.

### Unity Session

-   10:06PM

    Unity session ended perfectly and it gave me some cool concepts that I could play around with!
    I am thinking that it would be interesting to see if we could have the notification bot hook into the irc and twitch chat, then relay that information between them.
    Furthermore we could have it be relayed all into the discords irc chat, so a tri-level integration of chat.
    This also gives me a chance to setup the Twitch login for the Supabase Auth system!
    A really cool concept would be to allow the people in the chat to spawn themselves as zombies into whatever scene we are in, just to test the logical movement between the chat and game dev side.
    I suppose it be pretty simple if we look at from the command, `!zombie` and then we have the virtual container find the prefab , then add it into the play scene, maybe even do something cool like have their twitch name above the zombie.
    This would not be that hard given that we have most of the tools in place to do this.

### CICD Pipelines Improved v4

-   06:54AM

    Finally got around improving the CICD pipelines, making it easier to move from atomic, dev and main.
    Just need to clear through some of the orphan branches and test case it without running into code review problems.
    Oh no, I think I created an infinite loop of cicd pipes.

-   08:57AM

    Time to take a quick nap, I was able to resolve some of the issues.
    We will have to figure out a way to handle them in the future, with a bit more skill and hmm it seems that it might not be the best right now.

## 2024

**Longhorn**

There might be an issue with longhorn and the `multipath.conf` for our nodes, thus we will have to update the configuration on all the nodes to handle it.

**Ansible**

To prepare for the github actions to execute the ansible playbook, we would have to create a new key and place that inside of each of the containers.

**MicroOS**

The homework for this weekend will be to read into the usage of [MicroOS](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/2674).
As the issue ticket states, we want to utilize the `MicroOS` for our next worker deployment.
Ideally, we should deploy it via ansible through github actions but that iaac is not yet setup on our framework.
For this deployment, we can use terraform to help us set it up and execute it!
The terraform script will be placed inside of the `/tools/scripts/public/proxmox`

**Postgres**

Spent the night trying to get the core of postgres and the namespace of `supabase` setup!
After doing a bunch of different test deployments, I think we have a better understanding of what needs to be built and a clear goal in mind with the helm chart and deployment.
One of the areas that I was thinking of looking into was utilizing github actions for the deployment but that might be in the near future for now.

## 2023
- 10:21am - Using ChatGPT to just quickly write out some content is becoming an addiction and I believe it might be the real mindwoke virus xD. 
- 11:00am - Okay! For my unsplash project, I was able to secure the camera but now the issue is getting a digital frame that can render the images with a bit more pixel density. Currently the frame that I have right now has a terrible resolution and under the intense light from the sun, most of the artwork looks like pretty bad. Furthermore, I do need to test my photo skills, including how well I am at for figuring out the different lighting.
- 5:58pm - Updated some of the minor components on the main page of KBVE! I am not too big of a fan of the current layout, I might have to find another way to handle it.
