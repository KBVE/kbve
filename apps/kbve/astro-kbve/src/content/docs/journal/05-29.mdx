## 2024

**Heat**

Oh the weather is starting to get hot and my room is feeling it!
I am in my underwear and staying indoors why my body bakes next to these 4090s.


**Resume JSON**

The schema is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/v1.0.0/schema.json) and it would make the most sense to use it.
Rather than having to write our own schema that no one would be really using, this would make it easier to keep everything to some level of a standard.

**Astropad**

We can migrate some of the `astro-ve` into the `astropad` library that we will be using down the line.
During this process, we can clean up a decent amount of the plugins and folder stucture to make it cleaner and easier to use.
I will backtrack my dynamic plugin system but keep that within the `astro-ve` and for the `astropad`, we will use a more simple file system.
The plan would be to keep all our tooling and visual components the way they are right now but slowly rewrite them into simple astropad structures.
A good way to think about astropad would be to be a helper library that will eventually be built around starlight.

To start the Astropad, we will run this simple generation command.

```shell
nx generate @nxtensions/astro:lib astropad
```

This will create our boilerplate for the astropad that we can then call and use as we please.

I made some slight changes to the `tsconfig` for the Astropad, hopefully these minor changes will make it easier to import the different tools and components from the Astropad.

**Invoice**

While we are building out the Resume application, I want to migrate over the invoice application into the Astropad.

## 2023

- 8:30am Happy Memorial Day! I did not have any major plans for this weekend, I am still in the grindset mode but my sleep schedule is still a mess.
- 11:00am - Going to look over that Magic shell script that Ziggy found and see if I can add that into KBVE. One of the ideas I was having for it was to integrate a basic GPT into the questions that the user types into the application? So it combines the audio return of yes / no but also gives you a GPT generated response via the typewriter effect. Its a bit tough to describe the product, as I can already see how to build it out within my head. Putting the pieces together will be the focus.
- 4:00pm - Quick league matches with the homies, doing some chores and then going back to updating some of the applications. 
- 5:00pm - One of the things that has been stopping the puppeteer from scraping is anti-bot protections that websites have. So I am thinking of ways of going around it, not for any other reason but science. Within the industry, this is known as the Cat and Mouse game, where developers on both, red and blue teams, are trying to beat each other. 
- 9:30pm - Going to see if I can get a mock version of the magic conch shell up and running! There are two ways I could do the background image of bikini bottom, I could add it into the background scene or I could load it.
