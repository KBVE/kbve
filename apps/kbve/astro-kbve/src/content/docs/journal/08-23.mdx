## 2024

**Wedding**

Today is the end of the most important aspect of our trip to Italy!
My cuzin getting married inside the heart of Tuscanny is super dope and definitely romantic.
This trip is making me think twice about my life goals, makes me do that double check swing.


**Expo**

In between the events, I am taking a small breather and doing some general test casing.
Expo always feels like a pain to setup and build on, but I need to get an application up and running before the end of the month.
We want to make sure that there is a fully functional application for us to manage in the fall of this year.
Hold up, Nx can automatically update the code for my expo applications to the latest version that I would need?
This is actually super useful, saves me a bunch of headaches and indirectly a bunch of time as well.

In the future we could extend the shell script to create a new branch off the dev, run the update and then make a pull request with that update?
I suppose in that situation, we could also have it run a bunch of tests and handle some of the dev cycles for us as well?

For future reference, the command is:

```shell
pnpm nx install expo-cityvote --check
```

But I am thinking we could extend it out into:

```shell
./kbve.sh -autodate
```

This could then be done via github actions too, that would be an interesting avenue to take?
We are getting a step closer to self learning and self building code!

**Build Failure**
While going through the latest journal entry, I forgot that certain original markdown might cause issues.
In this case, it was looking for a `notBetween` function , uh basically I have to becareful with mdx, because I could inject random javascript code without thinking it through.




## 2023

- 8:10am - I believe I got the general flow of the docker container! Yay!

- 6:51pm - Going to sync the notes in between the sessions. Okay, now I need to add github actions to the `NodePy`. so that it can build the images without having any major issues. As for the key storage, I am thinking that it would be an AES style encryption, so that there would not be any major issues. 

- 7:40pm - I added the docker image creation test casing, under the workflow. Going to add the Clarifai Python and then maybe cargo too.
