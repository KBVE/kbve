### Unity Dev Session

- 03:40PM

    Preparing before the next unity dev session!
    There are a couple things that I was hoping to resolve before this meeting but I did fall behind in some situations.
    Since we did not get a chance to finish the kbve site, but its okay, it should be ready by next week.
    As for the pre-meeting preparing, I just need to make sure that the local webgl build finished without any issues.

- 03:50PM

    The panel still looks a bit dicey and maybe we can get that ItemDB implementation out of the way?
    I suppose since each item would have its own ULID aka 16 byte reference id, we can use that for this.
    When adding the item into the game, it should have the ULID as a reference, which should then be in the payload.
    So when placing the item, instead of sending the prefab name, we would send the ULID, which would then get processed by a web worker + indexdb.
    This means we can keep the scope of data transfer small and make it easier to abstract away some of the issues.
    Unity sends the event of `Item->Use()` with the `ULID` of the item.
    The React component then gets this `ItemEvent` and it uses the `ULID` to represent the item that was being used.
    By having this one-to-one relationship, we can then make the inventory easier too, by sending a `Map` of the `ULID`?
    Actually it be an `Array` with the `index` being the slot that is being used in the `inventory`?
    Hmm, the actual data structure that we use wont be too important because we can easily swap around it.
    That means we need to keep a local image on the Astro side as a reference.

    ItemDB - The concept could be tough to maintain in the long term. We can even reduce some of the informal stats as well.
    `[*] => [[Structure], [Defensive], [Crafting]]`, this is the enum style that we could introduce!
    The item schema could be stored inside of the `ItemDB` and then we just import it into the `Astro Config` for the collections.
    I wonder if there might be two ways to handle the `ID` which could be through a `BigInt` and `ULID`?
    The `BigInt` would be just the rolling IDs for internal indexing, then we can keep the `ULID` for searching quickly?!
    This is the `ItemCategoryFlags` that we can utilize for the base operations of the enum.

```js

export enum ItemCategoryFlags {
    None = 0,
    Weapon = 0x00000001, // 1 << 0,
    Armor = 0x00000002, // 1 << 1,
    Tool = 0x00000004, // 1 << 2,
    Food = 0x00000008, // 1 << 3,
    Drink = 0x00000010, // 1 << 4,
    Potion      = 0x00000020, // 1 << 5
    Material    = 0x00000040, // 1 << 6
    Resource    = 0x00000080, // 1 << 7
    Skilling    = 0x00000100, // 1 << 8
    Combat      = 0x00000200, // 1 << 9
    Structure   = 0x00000400, // 1 << 10
    Magic       = 0x00000800, // 1 << 11
    Quest       = 0x00001000, // 1 << 12
    Utility     = 0x00002000, // 1 << 13
    Depletable  = 0x00004000, // 1 << 14
    Legendary   = 0x00008000, // 1 << 15
    Vehicle     = 0x00010000, // 1 << 16
    Pet         = 0x00020000, // 1 << 17
    Soul = 0x80000000,
}

```
    Okay we can use this as the core enum and flags for the base item set, I will combine enums later on once we have a couple more items added.


### Unity RareIcon Session

-   11:10PM

    The session went great and we got the blueprinting out of the way!
    Now the players can place items without any major issues but there could be some minor improvements, one being that the objects are being marked in the default layer.
    Okay, after finishing up the general build and test casing, we can move forward with adding some of the farming style logic to certain items.

## 2024

**Display**

The docker image is having some issues with the display, which I need to fix!
Having multiple displays would be a nice feature in the future doe.

Spent the whole day trying to figure out what the issue was with the display and it seems that we were using the wrong vnc server software.
However I believe we also had some issues with wayland on ubuntu!

Yet after countless hours and league matches, we were able to make a breakthrough.
Now there are still a decent amount of steps required before we can move forward, including the migration of the websocketify into the FastAPI.

**League**

I am doing terrible since the recent item changes, I think they buffed almost every champion to an extent that the damage output is insane!
The solution would be to shift a bit more towards an off tank shaco build, where I can use my clone to start team fights more often.

**Roast**

The roast of holybyte was a great event, 10/10, it was exactly what I was expecting and it still delivered beyond it.

## 2023

- 8:00am - Need to get back onto the workout flow here in the states! Damn I have to stop being lazy, maybe for fun, I should make a GPS based alarm clock? The only way to turn off the alarm clock is by going to a specific GPS location. So instead of a snooze button, it would be the GPS location that would turn it off. This was a shower thought but I think it would be an interesting concept to build out.

- 11:00am - I been holding off too long for my Twitch stream, I think it might be interesting to bring it back up? Granted there will not be any viewers but it would great to record some of the games, specifically the gameplay, and maybe develop software that could parse through the data and grab unique clips? This could be extended out to other areas later down the line as well. Too bad that I am trash at league or the the content would have been great to watch haha.

- 12:45pm - Traveling to eye doctor and comparing it to the doctors office yesterday, this office is super old school. They keep all their records in files and take a rather long time to process their patients. From what I noticed, they could hire an extra person that would slowly transfer over their records to a hybrid-cloud, one where the data is stored locally and within 3rd party data warehouses. The time it took to get from patient to queue was around 15 to 20 mins, including the double checking of the records, insurance, forms, ect.. this could easily be scaled down to 5 mins.

- 1:15pm - I should start to create more issue tickets regarding what areas that I need to focus on, this way I am not all over the place. After going through all the issue tickets, I will get back into programming and then head over to the mall.

- 1:30pm - Oh I had another idea for the GPS based application, I could sync it with a map style, so that I could sync with others that might want to go to the gym or to the park. The other side of this would be to make it easier to automate the sync of activities, like going for a hike or going onto an adventure?!

- 2:00pm - The search on the main page was broken, going to go ahead and address that really quick. I think the style for the search can be improved later down, but for now, it would make sense to not over complicate things.
