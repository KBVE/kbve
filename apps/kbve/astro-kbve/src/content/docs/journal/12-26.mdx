    The core loader board will be just in react and I will try to hardcode the results.
    Yeah there is no need for the react code, because we could just grab the json data from the API during the build process, then just bake it into the build.
    This way we get zero javascript overhead and could even hardcore some crazy css effects because we do not have to promise or await the data.

    The plan is to rework the kanban data structure, so that we can expand upon it.
    Once the basic saving, loading and notes are done, we can move forward with adding in the AI tools around it.
    If everything can get up and running, we can move back around to the AStar pathfinding in unity.
    Okay the new docker image should start the build and now I am going to update the helm chart.\

    **GitOps**

    We need the unity game also running, so lets go back around and make sure that rareicon game server is up and running.
    To get the gameserver up and running, we need to include the repo URL, which is `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git` and the branch is `dev`.
    Then enable self-healing and add the path, `/migrations/kube/charts/rareicon` and we should have the gameserver up and running for rareicon.
