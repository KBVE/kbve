### Unity RentEarth Build Pipeline

-   06:22PM

    Looks like the Windows, MacOS and Linux builds are somewhat there, we still need to make some tweaks!
    I am currently building out the player hud and then will look at adding some menu options for the player.
    A decent amount of the updates to do this jolly good day!

### Github Leaderboard on KBVE

-   11:45PM

    Before the year ends, I need to put the leaderboard back on the main page of KBVE!
    It would be really interesting if I could make a scoreboard and even turn it into a weird game?
    I am not too sure but I will keep cookin until I get something cool to play with.

    **Kanban**

    Okay! We are almost done with the generic or well base kanban board.
    Getting it all operational is the goal for today, then I will shift over to adding additional features.
    Okay we need to push forward with some of the minor updates and get the new docker image built out!
    Let me move the rust and react code up for now and loop back around, hopefully resolving the CORS issue.
    The docker image of 1.02 was published, so now I am going to update the helm chart and have it deploy the new one.

    **React**

    Okay we got the communication between the kanban and the react component going, now we just need to figure out how to maintain that easy flow.
    Right now its not pulling the right data from the api state, so I am going to focus on resolving that next.

    **MerryXMas**

    Happy holidays!
    Forgot to include that in my notes, xD
    I am thinking of redoing the whole kanban system to help keep track of the notes a bit better, maybe even expanding the item collection that would be involved.
