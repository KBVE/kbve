    **Profiles**

    The realm of trying to figure out profiles has begun again, ugh, so much time wasted.
    I am just not understanding how the profiles are being created and stored, hmm.

    **Login**
    
    This is actually a two part concept, we want to make sure that we can setup supabase and log into that instance.
    Then after the supabase connection is established, pull the relatable runescape account information and then login from there using that information?
    There are still a couple moving parts that we would need to address before we can really get this going but we will start small.

    The command to add a package will be:

    ```shell

    pnpm nx run atlas:add --name supabase

    ```
    
    Now we need to figure out how to setup the atlas but within the scope of a user.
    Yet going to move on from today, I was not able to create as many notes that I would have liked.
