    **TSLA**

    We will have to roll the options out to next week and grab the $1000, just to make sure that it works.

    **Unity**

    Sound manager vcontianer needs to be fixed, which we need to do before tomorrows meeting.
    I am thinking that we would try to wrap everything inside of a vcontainer, making it easier for us to access the resources.
    For us to setup the sound manager, we would have to link the scriptable object through addresses, which means we need to define them as well.
    Inside of the `mmextensions`, we can add an assembly reference to Unity.

    **Arcane**

    Finally got to start the series and its been a wild ride, err, rather a blast, so far.
    I am going to be a bit sad when it ends because it has been a great series, but I am here for it all.
    The new ARAM map also slaps, I love what they did with it and it finally makes zeri, bard and talon both a bit more fun to play.
