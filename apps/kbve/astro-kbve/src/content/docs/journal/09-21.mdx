## 2024

**Fleet**

This will be our next attempt at deployment through ranchers fleet, again there are some random issues that might be from how we setup the fleet.yaml?
Back into the `/migrations/kube/charts/armada` we will be going into and making adjustments to help with the deployment.
I am going to go back and try a completely different approach with setting up the charts for armada, maybe having the armada be its own internal chart and then reference the bitnami charts as a dependency.
This might work out better in the long term but we still need to add the kustomize!
For that part of the requirement, I will come back around after it is deployed and replicated and make a `base`, `dev`, `prod`, ect...

Yes! We finally were able to get the redis and the sealed secrets to be deployed, so it seems that using the dependency style is the way to go.
This means that we can start to add external charts into our main armada chart.yaml and deploy them directly into our cluster.

Now the next test case would be to deploy the sealed secret for redis and then apply it directly to our redis cluster.
This is with the `secrets` folder and a yaml for each of the secret that we need to add into the cluster.

From my understanding, the first step would be communicating with the seal, passing through the secret and getting back the signature?
After we get the signature, we would then setup another yaml within the armada repo for the gitops.
I am going to save the base commands for this and see where we can go from there.

```shell

kubectl create secret generic redis-auth --from-literal=redis-password=<new-password> --namespace armada --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-secret.yaml
kubeseal --controller-name=sealed-secrets --controller-namespace=armada < redis-secret.yaml > sealed-redis-secret.yaml

```

Okay so we added the sealed redis secret to the repo and now we will deploy it and see what happens!
Great! Looks like the secret was applied without any major issues.
Noo! I forgot to set the enable flag for the redis auth and now its failing to authenticate, damn it.

**Grafana**

Updating the armada fleet so that the redis instance can export its data into grafana.
The goal would be to test case the ability to communicate between our grafana's visual charts and our redis instance while doing everything through the fleet gitops.
If everything goes as planned, then we can extend it out later on with the supabase information as well, thus have a central chart for everything we run.

**RAW**

Watching this horror flim called RAW, which is in french and so far its been great!
I think the main actress is also super cute xD
Nevermind, I am way too afraid of her going crazy and eatting me.
My jimmy would never wake up if I saw her lmao, the flight mode would be activated 24/7 around that type.

**Brotherhood of the Wolf**

Keeping up with the french movie dive, the next movie that we would watch is about this mythical creature commiting crimes.
So far the movie is interesting and has a decent lineup of unique characters, but the racial undertones are also pretty crazy.

## 2023

- 9:00am - Looks like the feds took the whole market down a bit! Exciting to see how it will play out for the remaining week and even the rest of the year.
- 11:15am - Meeting before lunch, I think I am going to also take tomorrow off because I am tired and want to focus on Appwrite! I also have to create a whole new document for October, which I will bang out tomorrow mid-day as well.
- 3:16pm - Okay the general settings page looks good! I am going to push that out and see where I can go from there. Damn this is such a first world problem, I can not screen share at higher 4K, without it looking super buggy.
