## Notes

## 2025

-   **Godot**

    08:45AM

        Finished up a quick godot meeting and now switching gears to focus on getting past that last hurdle.
        The goal of the extension is so that we can use it again in the future without having any major issues.

    04:53PM

        The next update will be for the load textures in 2D/3D, but before I spend too much time on that, I need to finish up the hex map generation.
        Currently the goal is to use the bevy ecs to help generate the world and fill in the hex tiles but the formula that I am using is not really working as I would have hoped.

-   **ShieldHero**

    09:05PM

        Watching season 2 of the shield hero while slowly drifting to sleep, I been slacking on the digital journal updates but I still keep a written log of all my journal entries.

## 2024

    -   6:30am  -   `Dreams`

        #### Dreams
        
            I was having some wild dreams of traveling the world as a crypto exchanger lmfao.
            Basically an international middle man that would over see the transfer of everything, from stolen goods to obtuse insurance problems.
            Like it could have been an epic series, hmm, that really gets me thinking!


    -   10:30AM -   `Rust`

        #### Rust

            Going to clean up the template again, maybe removing some of the additional behaviors from the side bar and probably sticking to just a grid view.
            After I clean all that up and get a base demo out of the way, I want to extend out the grid system using the erust state management.
    
    -   5:00pm  -   `SQL`

        #### SQL

            It might make sense to use both the bigint and ulid for the table management, thus I might have to go back and basically redo all the tables again.
            Thank god we do not have a large amount of data, so migrating this back would mean a bit of refactoring but the whole `kbve` package does need it regardless.
            I will update these notes again with how I plan to do that migration.
