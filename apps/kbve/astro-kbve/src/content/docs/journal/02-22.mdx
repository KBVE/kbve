## Notes

## 2025

### URF

-   12:43AM

    Another quick URF game before going back into the programming eco-system.
    
### B13

-   12:45AM

    The next update that I want to make would be for the heat management.

-   06:13AM

    To increase the speed of the animation, we have to adjust the `scale_speed` , which is set to a default of 1.
    The asteroid explosion felt a bit too slow, so we will double it.
    As for the short exhaust, we can go ahead and quad truple it.

-   09:19PM

    We are running the clock down for this submission!
    Got about less than 9 hours until submission is closed, hopefully we can get some of the core gameplay loop out of the way.

## 2024


### ClockWork

I am looking for another device that is a bit open source and is handheld!

It would also not have an x86 but an ARM, so that I could test case egui applications on an arm chipset / deployment. 

Granted I do have my mac m1 but I was hoping to have another linux device, probably an ARM ubuntu device, that I could do development work on while I am traveling or outside of my man cave.


### Date

The journal entries had to have a time of `12:00:00` because during the parsing, I was getting some wild timezone errors because of it.
The other option was trying to find a way to slip time into the entries but I figured that would cause problems in the future.

So it should be noted that we need to make sure that time is included in the date!

However, I know myself, I will forget to do that often, oh well.



### DND

Time for a DND session!
Today we are going to untap the wine barrel and maybe go into the sewer tunnels.

I been thinking of a new DnD homebrew item, called Odins Necklace, which would give +1/+2 AC but it would automatically lower my initiative rolls by -3 or -5.
This necklace is based upon the Cloak of Protection but I am thinking it would make sense to focus on building the paladin out to be tanky but less focus on damage. 

I am here to tank but also not die lmao.


### Comic

After the DND session, I decided to take a break on the flexbox and focus on the grid system within CSS.

To get a bit better at understanding and using the grid system, I decided it would make sense to look into a comic book style design pattern.

Thankfully GPT and Google were filled with examples and concepts, of which, I decided to translate them from the generic CSS and into a tailwindcss style.

There are some other plans that I have with the comics but I will keep them in the back burner for now.
