    **Gameserver**

    We want to make sure that the gameserver deployments have a connection to our discord proxy.
    Yet it seems that there are no connections to our axum deployment, which means we need to fallback into the client code and see the issues that might be causing the js to not connect.
    The mistake that I realized was that we were calling the DiscordSDKManager but instead we need to call the Manager singleton.
    Pushing that up right now and seeing where it will go from that point.

    **Fudster**

    The deployment of `Fudster` is once more below:
    
    Repo: `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git`
    Branch : `dev`
    Paths: `/migrations/kube/charts/fudster`

    We will have to wrap around the kong / JWT auth system, which is another adventure that we need to get into.
    I am thinking that we could just have that sit in between the actual websocketify from kasm, ugh, this is always annoying to map out.
    The only solution at this point for the reverse proxy would be to just go back around and fix up the kasm client bundle.

    **FFI**

    Okay we are able to establish communication between our gameserver and the discord activities, but there will be still be some additional things that we need to resolve.
    Ugh, okay so we know that once the connection is established, we are sending back, okay this is starting to make more sense to me.
    The best way would be rather to build out a general json connector, it would focus on sending back and fourth the json data between the webgl and javascript.
