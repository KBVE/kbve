## 2024

**Supabase**

Today I am going to test case the postbin concept using supabase, part of that will be to setup the datatome table and making sure we can post json to it.
I think there can be some performance upgrades that we can do on it as well, including switching the json serialization to a rust-based extension or a wasm wrapper.

**Proxmox V8**
Upgrade complete, will update the notes for this later on!
Everything from 7 to 8 went great and I am actually surprised how easy it was.
The key command that I recommend is `pve7to8 --full` and making sure that everything else, vm wise, is offline.
Then go through the general steps that they recommend for upgrading from 7 to 8, making sure to keep track of the files that need to be changes.

**Deckhouse**

The whole deckhouse was a cluster kubber phuck!
We ran into so many issues, ended up staying up until 4am trying to debug them.
The documentation for deckhouse was trash and we spent so much time going through the operations that I feel the need to take a break from it.

## 2023

- 5:05am - On the PC this early? I woke up way tooo early, the sun is not even out yet and this screen is way too bright for my eyes. 

- 10:24am - Need to quickly catch up on the 3rd episode of Ahsoka, I am super excited for this mini-series and so far it has been great! It definitely has a bit of a slower vibe but I am enjoying the way they are looping the timeline and handling the world building. I should be careful not to put too much information out there as well. 

- 11:36am - A couple hours of just chilling and now I am getting ready to mount the CPU heatsink onto the tower.
