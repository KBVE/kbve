### Andor Season 2

-   02:00PM

    The second season of Andor is out and the first three episodes are amazing!
    I feel like I am about to watch a whole movie series again, this is some of the best Star wars yet.
    I dont want to give out any spoilers but top tier acting and writing.

### Disoxide v1.4

-   03:28PM

    Getting a near full CICD might be possible soon for our disoxide, but that might be just a bit too much for now.
    We trigger the builds via the `README.md` for disoxide and after the release is done, we need to grab the latest sha of that image.
    With that latest image, update the helm templates and then finally minor bump the following pre-release.
    This is just quick notes on maybe a `rancher` command that we could add into the kbve.sh to handle this for us.

### Astro KBVE UXUI

-   06:42PM

    Another shot at figuring out unique ways to handle the user interface and user experience!
    I am going to try and keep the internal core as close to vanilla javascript, this way if I need to use it in React or Rust in the future, it wont be an issue.
    The plan is to expand the `window.kbve` with a state called `uiux` which will hold a nested nanostores map.
    

## 2024

**API**

Looking back at our 2023 notes, its wild to see the shift in changes.
We migrated out of Appwrite/Strapi and ended up back to writing our own API!
Yet back then, the times were very simple.

**Projects**

Migrating the KBVE Projects over to the official docs!
A couple issues with the migration, some of the mermaid graphs did not go through and need to be fixed.
The solution might be to just go back and import the astro file that would handle the mermaid, but I am wondering if they have an inhouse one for Starlight.

**Migration**

There are more migrations that need to be done to the official website but we are making some headspace towards it.
A couple proof of concepts were added and tested, but now its really the large amounts of data that needs to be shifted over.
The documentation needs to be reviewed, changed and updated across a couple hundred different asset classes, furthermore, a couple hundred stocks still need to be added.


## 2023

- Astro -> React -> GraphQL/REST -> Appwrite -> Strapi
- The chain of command might seem a bit too much but I think it should help wrap up most of our front-end journies. Afterwards, I will clean up and prepare for May dev logs.
