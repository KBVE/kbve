## Notes

## 2025

### Redis Jedi RESP3

-   06:05AM

    Adding support for both the `bb8-redis` and our own internal redis resp3 integration.
    Our goal would be to keep a straight connection via both methods, ideally should prepare us for a cluster setup as well.
    After the redis setup, we can split the postgres, n8n and lambda next.

### CI/CD Disoxide v1.2

-   06:51AM

    Going to add both local docker support and after a couple test cases, I will add the kube chart.
    Furthermore, while I am building that kube chart out, I should also include the n8n instance because then I can place it right next to the redis.
    Keeping the n8n close to the redis will be extremely useful for performance.
    Notes on the [n8n integration](https://kbve.com/application/n8n/)

### JEDI Sidecar

-   10:41PM

    Expand the `jedi` crate to include a sidecar module that would help load the environmental variables.
    The first two areas of focus will be the general ENV pass through and `_FILE` support.
    After getting both of them out of the way, we can look into providing other unique ways of extracting the secret information, maybe vault access?
    

## 2024


### Bathroom

The upstair bathroom is almost done! Yay!
I can not wait to get back into my normal flow and having decently warm water again.


### Expo BBQ

I will try to build out the components with minor changes here and there.

I am thinking the color choice and abstraction should be built into the components, but I am not too sure yet.


### State

Nothing makes me enjoy my morning coffee, like thinking about state management!
Once I get a bit more work done in the client side, I will most definitely look into building the final client-side state management library, which I want to use every where! Muahaha.


### BBQEmbed

The BBQ Embed will handle the WebView and Iframe embeds!

We created the `BBQEmbed.tsx` within the `expo-bbq` and now we want to go ahead and render it within the `lcagents` app.

```js

<BBQEmbed src="https://kbve.com/arcade/itch" />

```


### GahAction

Time to do some of the classic github actions! GaHActions baby

Action to run the serve -> `pnpm nx serve expo-lcagents`
Now I am going to assume the build might require some work!

We will look into the publish websites with Metro, here is how we can go about doing that, [document for reference](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/publishing-websites/).

Okay! To build out the website, we run this command: `./kbve.sh -nx expo-lcagents:export`, which exports out to `dist/apps/expo-lcagents/` and we can then make it deploy to the LC-Agents repo.
