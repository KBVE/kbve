    **Astro**

    There is this temp astro patch that I want to try, which should solve our astro build problem.
    Hmm, okay I tried to the hacky patch to try and resolve the bug but sadly there was no luck.
    Kinda sad tht our whole pipeline has to be held off because of a nx extension breaking, which kinda of does not make logistical sense.
    Spent the whole day trying to get it to work but stil lost in the sauce.
    The only other solution I have would be to just remove the whole astro extension and migrate down to the typescript level of operations.

    Okay the only option that I see is just to drop the nx extension for astro and use a custom typescript builder.
    We will have to remake the commands in the astro nx extension.

    ```json

    "targets": {
		"build": {
			"executor": "@nxtensions/astro:build",
			"options": {}
		},
		"dev": {
			"executor": "@nxtensions/astro:dev",
			"options": {}
		},
		"preview": {
			"executor": "@nxtensions/astro:preview",
			"options": {}
		},
		"check": {
			"executor": "@nxtensions/astro:check"
		},
		"sync": {
			"executor": "@nxtensions/astro:sync"
		}
	}

    ```

    Furthermore I am thinking we can migrate the existing astro websites to expo, besides our kbve main repo.
    RareIcon, Herbmail, ect.. should be all
