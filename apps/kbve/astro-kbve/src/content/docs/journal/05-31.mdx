## 2025

### Unity ItemDB

-   10:02AM

    Updating the `ExtendedHealth.cs` script to handle the bonus stats from item usage.
    That means we will have to step back and take a look at the StatData script first, including some additional parts that we missed during the first time we created the script.
    There will be three or four variations to the stats, from a flat percentage bonus, to a static bonus via items and also temporary bonus.
    Furthermore the static bonus via items can be a factor of what the player has in their inventory, our goal here would be to encourage the player to build up and utilize the items.
    Wait, even past that, we have to account for the equipment for each character, ah this can become complicated very quickly.

### NPC Orchestrator

-   05:08PM

    This will handle the spawning and the usage of the different NPCs on the map!
    Our goal would be to prepare the NPC MDX, so not only will be able to add items at a large scale, we can also start producing the NPCs at the same rate.
    As for the NPC animation and the state management, both of those can be handled with this system.


## 2024

Got a great idea for a new tool, I figured that I might build it out really quick since I am stuck on the invoicing and resume tool.
The worst feeling in the world is when you can not finish a tool and then you start another tool, and then you dont finish that one and start another tool.
It is like the ADHD programming problem.

Yet I think the key is to find ways to make the different and unique tools work together, kinda like building multiple lego sets but the goal is not to actually build out the final set but rather discover the different pieces that you can make?
Like imagine you have a single 1 by 1 lego piece and then you realize that it is easier to build with 2 by 2 square pieces! Yet sometimes you need to split the 2 by 2 with 4 of the 1 by 1 pieces.


## 2023

- 10:00am - Most of this day will be spent working on the Conch react script but also figuring out the basics of the cloud functions. The idea here will be to isolate as much of the script(s) that I am building and move a certain amount of the logic into cloud functions. I do also want to move certain functions into their own worker threads but that will be something that I can work on later down the line.
- 1:00pm - It looks like we can continue development of RogueJester but at a limited scale, at least until we get a better understanding of the whole project. Starting Monday, we will begin a month of active but slow development. We will be doing about 3 weeks of development currently but hopefully it is enough to get the whole game to at least beta / demo.
