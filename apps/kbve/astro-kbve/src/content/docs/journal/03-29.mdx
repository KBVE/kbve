## Notes

## 2025

### Warcraft Hardcore

-   05:49AM

    Level 34 Mage Hardcore!
    Lets go? Magi for the win?!

### Sidecar

-   06:36AM

    Updating the `sidecar.rs` in the Jedi crate for the twitch relay!
    Besides wrapping around the login, I find the development cycle to be way too slow and annoying, hmm.
    Maybe the best way to load the env variables for the twitch bot might be through the postgres / supabase secrets?
    But if I go down that path, then I have to peddle back and finish up the supabase integration, ugh!
    I was reading up on Nix, maybe that might be the next route in my development journey.

### Unity

-   03:57PM

    Saturday means Unity!
    We will be looking at another unity session, hopefully one that will go nice and smooth this time around.
    To be honest, I been slacking on the unity side, so I should spend a weekend or two catching myself up and finally resolving that javascript ffi issue.
    Before the session starts, let me do a quick webgl build and see where we stand.

-   04:28PM

    Unity WebGL build is failing but I can not tell exactly where the dev build is failing.
    The error logs are all over the place, maybe I have some old cache data?
    Best bet would be to clean it all up and try again, I was making room earlier and maybe I might have removed something important.

## 2024


### Ruffle

There was some issues with Ruffle being loaded twice! So it seems that there might be issues in the future with how we load the library, but for now I was able to get it working again.

This can be an interesting test case for future problems that I need to break down, including the dynamic loading of certain types of content, including the phaser or adsense.

The core of the problem was that it was importing and registering the `astro-ruffle` twice, once from the `astro-ve` library and then again with our custom library. The solution, at least in the future, would be to extend the `astro-ve` ruffle component, rather than use the one that we are using,
Yet I feel like that a decent amount of the content does not need to be included inside of the library, as it is a waste of time for everyone involved, mainly because it feels like its an offset library that I do not plan on using on any other website.

Lets go ahead and push this all up the CI/CD and make sure that it works in the production phase.


### Applications

The next part of the application process would be to setup a `video` embed, which I am going to do next!
Okay so the bento grid needs to be updated and the dark theme needs to be stripped out, partly because we do not need to support a light theme.
I rather just stick with one universal theme and focus on that point, maybe later on we can use dynamic colors to help with the light shifting?

The `dark:` tailwindcss has been stripped out from the `bento` and now we can focus on the line clamping.



### Blog

Going to migrate a decent amount of the blog posts, :O that I have saved throughout the decade of time, into their new home directory.
I honestly hope that I do not have to do this again, any time in the future.

Currently the only one that I will migrate for tonight will be `theorycraft`.
