    **BlueSky**

    What is this social media hype about?
    I am thinking that is a decentralized social media site but what is it really about?

    **Scenes**

    Looks like when I updated the TopDownEngine, it replaced the scene order, so we will have to go back around and update it.
    I believe that in the next round, we should start looking into removing some of the older assets that are getting imported.

    **VContainer**

    Trying to get a better understanding of how we would build that global map and there are a couple things that I will need to understand.
    In order to make the multiplayer easier, we will need to find a way to let the rust code that the live server sends back actually execute certain functions within the unity client.
    The idea here would be to allow the unity runtime to run some of the game logic based upon what the live server says, this way we can sync the data across a session?
    That means the rust server would be handling a decent amount of the actual game and the unity client / runtime would be designed to just handle the rendering and client-side logic?
    Damn this would change the way that we handle this game, hmm, there would be a decent amount of thinking that we would have to do.

    **Addressables**

    Okay the best way we can work on this project but without having to keep going back to the editor might be by placing all the prefabs as addressable objects?
    Then inside of the code, we can just call them dynamically and use them for the different parts of the scene?
    This would further move unity into a `shell` position and we can basically write our own logic around the shell?
    Explaining this would be tough, so maybe the best way to approach this would be by creating our own version around it.

    **LifetimeScope**

    The last part of learning will be focused upon the lifetime scopes.
    I am starting to get a better picture of how all of this would connect and I believe that I can make it work a bit better.
    Granted that making the optimizations before finishing up the game is always risky, but I think it will actually make it easier to maintain the whole game.
