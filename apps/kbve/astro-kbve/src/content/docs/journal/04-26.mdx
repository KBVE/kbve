## 2025

### Unity

-   06:15PM

    Deep diving into unity for majority of the day and then going to focus on multiplayer.
    The kilonet package needs to be rebuilt because it seems that the Unity transport is wrong and needs to be removed.
    We will have to build in a way where we are using websockets first and then add the UDP/TCP direct support later on.
    I am thinking that we might just use the websockets overall, ugh.

-   11:00PM

    The webgl build completes but it seems to fail to run and giving us a weird error?
    I am thinking that it will be an issue that I can look into after updating the binary streaming tomorrow.

## 2024

Just working on the internal aspects of the KBVE Monorepo!
I am thinking about the best way to handle the layout system right now.

**Arcade**

We made some minor changes to the arcade earlier this week!
I am hoping to wrap up the changes before the end of today!
The hero looks terrible and needs to be updated to fit the arcade, also we need to remove the scrolling.

**Webmaster**

Started to build out the webmaster tool, which was built a couple times in the past.
I am just updating the older codebase and rewriting the basics of it.
Hmm, other than that, its been a slow Friday!

**Dockerfile**

Its a bit late at night and it seems that Ubuntu 24 release has caused some of the dockerfile / docker images to break.
Ugh I will focus on these tomorrow.

## 2023

-   Learning GraphQL. Okay we got the basics of the AppWrite integration, i.e login, signup and user profile but there is no subscribe yet.
-   The newest restaurant that I enjoyed was `Indian Spices 4U, Manjalpur, Vadodara` , and it was damn amazing. They have an all you can eat / lunch special, so starve yourself for the whole day and then binge out on amazing egg dishes. I recommend asking for boiled eggs on the side, with no salt/pepper and then dropping them crushed into the curry gravy.
