## Notes

## 2025

### B13

-   12:09AM

    The gamejam is about to end and we have 6 hours until it ends!
    Sadly, I am thinking we will not be able to hit it before it ends, ugh but we are getting better at it.
    Hopefully the next gamejam, we will be better prepared for it.

### B13 Save Deferred.

-   12:22AM

    To help with performance, I am going to shift the auto-save from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
    Furthermore, I will move it into a call deferred, so that it will not be called during the main physics loop.

### B13 Earth

-   12:34AM

    The Earth planet should spawn in at 0,0 and if any ship comes near the planet, it will show the interaction menu.
    If the player hits the interaction menu, then it will open it up for them to see.

### B13 UIUX 

-   02:17AM

    Since we only have 4 hours until the jam comes to an end, I will hold off on the v2 upgrades!
    We can shift focus after the jam ends to looking at the Q crate and come back around to updating this game later on.
    There might be issues that come with this game but we can just move past it all, half the team just left.
    Next jam, I am going to have to find better mates, maybe work around it a bit more too.
    Shifting the focus for all of v2 until after the jam ends and taking it out of the repo.

### B13 Over

-   07:38PM

    We finished up the gamejam, it was a great run and I definitely learned a bunch.
    It sucks that we had some guys just bail out and but hey, it is what it is.
    Next months jam should be shorter and easier, I hope xD.
    1 jam a month.

### Start Q

-   07:43PM

    The Q Crate will be where we hold all our godot and bevy modules, with the goal of being able to quickly reuse them in future gamejams.

## 2024

### Expo

After playing around with expo a couple times throughout my life, back in the painful days and recently with an older rentearth application, I decided to pull the trigger and integrate the expo into the NX.
The NX integration is on my plate for this weekend, but there are a couple things that I know will cause issues, like making sure the iOS and Android pipeline work for a generic application.
Then after making sure that they work for a barebone html app, the real challenge will arise... which is getting the WASM embed that we made earlier to load into iOS and Android.

I will have to keep some distance with expo because I do not want to waste a bunch of time debugging random bugs over and over.

Preparing the tamagui install, we need two npm packages, the first is the core tamagui and the second is the tamagui/config.

For the custom configuration, we will extend out the tamagui config file and add our own little twists.

Since I want to test iOS deployment as the first test case, rather than web, it would make sense for me to do this on the m1 macbook.

We will split up the branch and run `pnpm install tamagui @tamagui/config`.

Going to run a quick nx report, making sure everything is within the green before moving on.

Now I am going back to the old RentEarth repo and going to review the code that I wrote earlier, getting a bit refresher on the syntax.


### Tickets

I will try to work around the Github tickets again, at least to keep track of the changes within the monorepo!

I am doing a solid job of keeping track of the issue tickets at work but I should not be lazy, ugh becoming complacent is a terrible thing to break out of.

The loop of doing nothing!

Okay we got 6 new tickets onto the board, hopefully we can hit around 50 by the end of this month!

### Pipeline

Lets test out the pipeline for the KBVE.com build and have it push the code out into another repo!
Just like how we are building the herbmail.com, we are basically swapping out the variables with kbve.com, thus making this process easier than I expected.

Under the `ci-main.yml` , we will extend the build and deployment, by copying over the two actions and switching the variables.

* **Action One** - Build the application using NX, since we already have that setup, while I am writing this out, I am going to test case it.

* **Action Two** - Deploy the source code. We will push the `/dist/` code from `dist/apps/kbve.com` to the `kbve/kbve.com` repo and under the docs folder.

We will have it push the `dev` branch but my concern might be that it will fail because there is no `docs` folder. Now there are two options that I am thinking through, should I run the action knowing that it will fail because the `docs` folder is not there? OR should I resolve that future problem now.

Ideally we want to run the action and have it fail at that error point, then go in and resolve it from that error point; the error point is a bit of a foresight and a good spot to have it fail at.

Eh, actually I will just quickly create a patch to resolve this issue before we run into it. 
The patch for `kbve/kbve.com` is `adding docs`, which just creates the `docs` folder and places the a simple `README.md` into the location.
I could have place a `.gitkeep` as well but that is a different story.


### Parrot

The way that I am thinking of setting up the Parrot discord music bot would be to first review over the code that is involved with running the bot.
Going through each of the file and getting a solid understanding of what it all dones.

The best part of this exercise is that I will get better at building discord bots and rust!
