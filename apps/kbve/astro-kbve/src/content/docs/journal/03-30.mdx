## Notes

## 2025

### Logo

-   05:10PM

    If I can figure out the task settings for chatgpt, I wonder if I can have it generate more logos and concept art while I am sleeping.
    We are almost at the future, where the AI systems can start performing work for us while I am doing other things.
    Mastering the art of task handling is the next big move for me.

-   06:44PM

    The task that I am going to create next will be for a daily logo generation.
    Here is the current prompt:
    `Design a unique logo concept featuring the letters 'K', 'B', 'V', and 'E'. The logo should be creative, visually appealing, and distinct from any previous designs. Incorporate a different style, theme, or artistic approach each day (e.g., minimalist, bold, futuristic, vintage, abstract, etc.), and describe the design in detail, including the arrangement of the letters, color scheme, typography or shapes, and any additional elements. If image generation is available, provide a detailed description suitable for creating the logo visually. The logo should feel fresh and original while prominently showcasing the letters 'K', 'B', 'V', and 'E'.`
    I set the logo generation to be for each day at around 8AM.

### March

-   05:22PM

    As the day is coming to an end, I need to make sure that all the bills are taken care of before the start of the next quarter.
    Damn, the co-pilot is getting a bit annoying with the journal entries, I will have to maybe disable it for the route of `/journal/*` or something of that nature.


### RareIcon

-   05:26PM

    Build trigger for RareIcon should be the project mdx file for it?
    `apps/kbve/kbve.com/src/content/docs/project/rareicon.mdx`
    Okay, going to edit the `utils-file-alterations.yml` inside of the workflow, to include any changes for `rareicon_unity`.
    Moving forward, we will use this key as a trigger for the unity build.
    Okay, went ahead and added the file changes and trigger, we can push this up to main.

## 2024


### Blog

It seems a couple routes for the `kbve.com` were not yet added, I am going to spend the day going through them all and adding anything that would be missing.

Some of the extra blog articles and documentation would be from the Google drive that we can pull and add into the `blog` content folder, but the different `docs` have to be converted to mdx._createMdxContent

Upon looking through the future blog posts that need to migrated, there are a couple embeds that are missing within the astro source code.



### Discord

Going to update the discord page just a tad bit, maybe add an animation and fix the invite link to the Discord server.
There might be an issue with the way that we are loading the `lottie` package, which I might have to defer or find a way to prevent it from blocking the main thread.



### Project

After fixing up the blog page, we would want to resolve the `project` page with all our active projects.
I am going to just take the old source code and move it over to here, then make small changes here and there until it works out.

As we extend out the codebase, we want to make sure that we keep checking and syncing the code changes, via `./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:sync` and `./kbve.sh -nx kbve.com:check`.
