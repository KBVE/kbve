    **Python**

    Starting the adventures of using supabase python, but its really been a troubling ride.
    I am under the impression that it would be rough but did not realize that I am digging really deep into the void.
    The login system for python can get a bit complex because we have a chunk of different moving parts to account for.

    **Expo**

    Decided to take a bit of a break from the java + python world and switch back over to the react native realm.
    I am starting to get a bit back into the drift of just running multiple codespaces again, but will try not to over do it this round.
    We will stick to around 3 max screens for now.

    On a side note, we are now officially done with the [tamagui](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/786) integration, so we can close that year old ticket out.

    **Components**

    Going to build a couple more updates tamagui components, after the minicard and then the next will be an improved slider / carousel tamagui component.
    I will place this inside of its own folder, then make adjustments from there.
    That might be a mistake, I think it will be another name that might not be `slider` but rather hmm.
    We can go with `Gallery` as the base folder and component holder for it all.

    **Migration**

    Moving the `plugin` / java code out of Atlas and into the Fudster package.
    The premise will be to decouple the the osrs / rsps from atlas and split the production of the two.
    This is just to make things easier when it comes to optimization and execution.

    **Fudster**
    
    For the dockefile, we will focus on the first stage, aka Alpha.
    To keeps things simple, I am going to split the stages up using letters and then give each step a number.
    Moving forward the codename for this project will just be fudster, which is fitting because it will be his anime click of e girls.
    For the stage alpha, the focus will be on building the jar

    **Longlegs**

    To continue the holloween movie adventures, we are watching a new movie from this year, called `Longlegs`.
    Oh snap it includes nick cage, this is going to be a wild run for sure.
    They movie was okay, I would say it was also just above mid but I might have been spoiled with the whole true detective season 1.
    When the bar is set so high, the rest of the ratings get hit with a downgrade.
