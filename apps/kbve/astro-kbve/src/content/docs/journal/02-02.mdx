## Notes

## 2025

-   **WoW**

    09:24AM

        The best thing to do in the morning is to do some general updates!
        I am thinking that I should focus on updating the wow page and get more information on there.

-   **Journals**

    09:43AM

        I forgot to update some of my older journals, but there are a couple things that I need to fix up?
        A standard format is still in the works, because it has to work each year too? Hmm

## 2024

    2:00PM
        
            Trying to run two codespaces at the same time, basically a test case for the edge void.
            The goal would be to emulate multiple codebase changes at the same time, eventually scaling up to 5 instances.
            There have been some suggestions on how to use CLI LLM models to help with the coding but I still need to work on the prompts.
            Furthermore, the amount of memory and overhead also increases with each instance, if everything is done with local models, however I could implement OpenAI endpoints for some instances. hmm
            I am thinking that the first split would be this instance is kept to a local reference and the main instance is kept to OpenAI.
            Basically since this is a WSL instance, it makes it easier to communicate with a local model and the Unity instance is on Windows, thus having it communicating with OpenAI.
