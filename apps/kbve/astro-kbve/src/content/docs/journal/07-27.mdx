### AirShip Music

-   11:08AM
    
    Trying to get the audio out of the way and then going to focus on the dialogue system.
    The gamejam is coming to an end soon, thus I am hoping that I can quickly put together the smaller parts of the game.
    One bug that I noticed was that the music seemed to pause a couple times randomly, I am going to try and move some of that out into a background global.
    This way the music should continue to play throughout the game, maybe we should have an adjustment for the music in the title screen.
    A good way to avoid getting the ears blasted, so let me adjust that for now.

### Airship ULID

-   11:16AM

    The ULID generation for the GDScript is still a bit painful, a couple errors in the int / float / dec logic.
    Them damn floating point errors keep floating into random projects, gosh darn it!

### Airship Settings

-   12:28PM

    Having the game load with a default master volume of around 20%, maybe since its a new player, we could also setup a custom screen.
    These are some of the uiux things that I will have to work out before the gamejam ends, I was hoping that maybe we could setup the supabase integration but that might be on hold.

-   05:26PM

    Too many hours have been spent going in loops with the UIUX, I am not too sure how I feel about it all.
    There might be a better way to handle refactors in the future, maybe its a bit too rough as the project grows too big.
    At least now I know in the future projects, to keep folders for specific scenes and just build around the scenes.
    It was mainly my fault because I was not being to exact with my commands and the backups started to cause some issues, this time around I will try to loop around to avoid ghost files.

**Virtual Joystick**

The next update for laser would be to add a virtual joystick to each scene.
This will make playing the games easier on mobile as well!
I was debating over either having a click to move or a virtual joystick to move the character.

**Funding**

There seems to be a bit of a mistake when it comes to funding, I think we might need to fix that up!
For now we will accept funding through Pateron and Github, but we can expand upon that in a later time.

**Sanitize Container Image**

For deploying the container image, we need to make sure that we also sanitize the image name.
This is the function that I am going to add into the `sanitization.ts`.

```ts

/**
 * Sanitizes the container image name ensuring it is alphanumeric and can include underscores, slashes, colons, and periods.
 * @param image - The container image name to sanitize.
 * @returns Sanitized container image name or throws an error if the name is invalid.
 */
export function sanitizeContainerImage(image: string): string {
  const sanitizedImage = image.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_:/.]/g, '');

  if (!sanitizedImage || sanitizedImage.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Invalid container image name. Image name must be alphanumeric and can include underscores, slashes, colons, and periods.');
  }

  return sanitizedImage;
}

```

After adding this function, we can go ahead and add the test code for it via vitest / jest.
Then we will test the library using our nx command.

```bash
./kbve.sh -nx devops:test
```

**Quest**

Came across an interesting idea for the quests, maybe we could make the first quest as a way to self improve?
We could look at different situations that a person is in and maybe give them some advice to handle it?
So let us think about the feeling of being angry and then have the player choose amoung a bunch of cards, one of them could be to "sing"?
Or if the case is that the person is feeling anxious, then we could display a couple cards with one of them being to "take deep breaths"?
I am still thinking through how I would handle the quests.

## 2023
- 2:30pm - Going through the base scene on the RogueJester aka RentEarth, trying to resolve the bug issue with Vuplex. The bug is being triggered by two points of interest, it seems to be related to a CORS policy, which is the No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, yet instead of it being a yellow caution, it seems be a red warning. The other issue is that the mouse is not being registered by the frame, so the mouse clicks are not passing through. I believe both of these can be resolved within a week or so, hopefully we can get it resolved sooner so we can move forward. 
- 2:57pm - As I am writing these notes down, I think it would be wise to publish this patch out and then sync the codebase? Hopefully it will not cause any major error, ah shit as I was writing this, I see that there is a merge conflict that is already appearing. Sometimes I do wish working with git would be easier. We need that AI agent to come in and do some general git cherry picking for us.
- 3:49pm - Okay there are a couple issues that we have to address with how we want to handle the scenes within RJ. I am thinking we would do a couple, maybe around 3-5 scenes within the base scene. As for the mission selection, we will try to display that through the UI/UX.
- 4:00pm - I suppose the market draw back from the increased rates, maybe we might see more 25bps rate increases throughout the year. 
- 11:06pm - Going to push the generic blog post patch and rotate over to the patch for tomorrow. On my test list, I need to research a bit more about a couple different topics, including `microwave pyrolysis` and how it can be used to recycle plastics.
