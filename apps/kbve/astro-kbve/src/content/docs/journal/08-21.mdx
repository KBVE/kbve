## 2024

**Morning**
The morning flow in Italy is crazy!
So much caffine that is floating in the air, I am like excited to go hang out with the old guys at a local cafe.
The only thing that they dislike is my crappy spanglish, which I understand and the craze of American politics.

**Florance**
The last day in this vibrant city before we head out to the rest of the nation.
I am going to try and see more of the main downtown area and maybe hit up a museum or two.

**Supabase**
For us to move forward with the supabase, we need to make sure that our instance of supabase can not only run but not crash.
One of the parts that I would like to focus on is also making an adjacent version that would not use supabase but indirectly talk with the postgres.
The zerocopy api that would work directly with postgres would be amazing and I would be all for it.

**MovieLibrary**
The greatest invention is the refurbished movie theater turned library.
I am shocked there is not any more of this!
Plus the best coffee is all around you, I think I could write a perfect paper here.

## 2023

- 12:25am - The ending hours of a hackathon! We got a couple hours to throw the whole application online, I can feel the stress going through my veins. We were having a ton of trouble with docker and appwrite functions, rough.

- 9:59pm - The hackathon is over! I am still stressed out over all the different adventures. I ended up spending most of the day sleeping, had to catch up on the `zzz`.
