    **Journal**

    I am getting this crazy feeling that the next year is going to be wild.

    **Actions**

    There is a tool called zizmor which performs a quick safety check on the action script.
    I believe our actions have some room to be exploited.

    We used this command :
    
    ```shell
    
    zizmor   --gh-token=$(gh auth token) ./.github/workflows
    
    ```

    We got a total of `258 findings (178 suppressed): 0 unknown, 18 informational, 0 low, 58 medium, 4 high`.
