## Notes

## 2025

### Ramen Soup

-   11:46AM

    Trying a new soup idea by mixing the shin ramen base with a low sodium chicken broth!
    In addition to the new broth, I am going to add some carrots, peas and broccoli but the method of doing this is a bit different.
    Before I even begin to boil the ramen, I am going to use another container to boil the chicken broth with the veggies, the goal would be to introduce some of the flavor into the peas.
    Once the broccoli is soft and almost mushy, I will bring it down to a low heat and start to the regular ramen process, afterwards mix both together into one large pot!
    Wait, no, I lied, I ended up cooking the ramen slowly in the smaller pot and going to keep the broth stored for tonight and tomorrow.
    I will have to get better at describing this process and maybe even start to make videos?

### M4

-   02:14PM

    The oil from my hands are already changing the feel of the keyboard, a bit of a disappointment since the first day of usage.
    It might just be too much power for my needs, I am very much going to return it and switch over to the mac book, damn buyers remorse already kicking in.
    There might be an excuse that I could come up with to keep it, I got 10 days to figure that out.

## 2024



### Phaser

We will be migrating the fish and chip game from a basic astro component to its own folder.
We might to add a babel setup for the vite to process, hmm.

The vite build path needs to be upgrade, all of this will be under the #880 ticket.

Folder is `/apps/react-phaser-fish-chip`.
Serve is `pnpm nx serve react-phaser-fish-chip`.


### BigMan

I am here to help fix up these damn images!

Okay, so we will be adding a couple new characters to our game, this is going to be a bit weird but I want to take logs from people and train the characters around them.

It would be like a preluded DnD style game, this will help with character development too because it is built around real humans with real emotions, but through the bulleyes of the internet, which is less of an eye.

@bigman1392: I will help with the tilemaps and general environment for the NPCs


### Bathroom

My bathroom walls are going down!
House construction is always a pain, definitely when it comes to the kitchen and the bathroom, I never felt more like a slug than this week.
I can smell the lack of water usage.
