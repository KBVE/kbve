    **Unity**

    Just finished a great 3 hour session in Unity!
    I got a better understanding of the tilemaps, upgraded unity to LTS 6 and made my first sprite animation.
    By next week, I want to create at least 3 or 5 new characters for the game.
    Now I have to spend most of the day working on the different tilemaps.
