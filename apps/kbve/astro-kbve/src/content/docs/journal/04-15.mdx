    Spent majority of the whole day on the game xD
    There are no major notes today besides the yearly review by Uncle Sam.

-   07:30PM

    I need to make a quick note on the plugins that we are using in 1.5x , maybe making a mod list for it all.
    I should also look into how mods get published too.
