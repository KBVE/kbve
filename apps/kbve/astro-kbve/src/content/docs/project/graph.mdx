## Graph

Introducing the KBVE Graph, a revolutionary upgrade to traditional graph views. 
Inspired by the Obsidian Graph View, our 3D graph visualization brings your interconnected MDX notes to life in a dynamic three-dimensional space.
Each node represents a unique note within our collection, seamlessly connected to related notes, providing an immersive and intuitive way to explore your data.
Navigate through the intricate web of information with ease, gaining deeper insights and a clearer understanding of complex relationships within your notes.


## Roadmap

The general roadmap outlining the key steps to create and deploy the KBVE 3D Graph:

<Steps>

1. **Project Planning and Requirements Gathering**
   - Define the scope and objectives of the KBVE Graph project.
   - Identify key features and functionalities needed for the 3D graph.
   - Gather and organize the MDX notes data to be visualized.

2. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Choose a 3D rendering library (e.g., Three.js, Babylon.js).
   - Select a framework for building the application (e.g., React, Vue).
   - Decide on a backend technology for data management (e.g., Node.js, Python).

3. **Initial Setup**
   - Set up the development environment.
   - Initialize the project with the chosen framework and libraries.
   - Configure version control with Git.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Parse and structure the MDX notes into a suitable format for visualization.
   - Create a schema for nodes and edges representing the notes and their connections.

5. **Graph Data Management**
   - Develop or integrate a database to store and manage the graph data.
   - Implement APIs for retrieving and updating graph data.

6. **3D Graph Visualization**
   - Set up the 3D rendering context using the chosen library.
   - Implement the core functionality to render nodes and edges in 3D space.
   - Add interactivity features like zoom, pan, and rotation.

7. **Node and Edge Representation**
   - Design visual representations for nodes and edges.
   - Implement different styles and colors to distinguish node types and connections.

8. **Interactivity and User Controls**
   - Add user controls for navigating the 3D graph (e.g., mouse and keyboard controls).
   - Implement node selection and tooltip functionality for detailed information.

9. **Search and Filter Functionality**
   - Develop features for searching and filtering nodes based on keywords and attributes.
   - Implement highlighting and focus mechanisms for search results.

10. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize rendering performance for large graphs.
    - Implement lazy loading and level of detail (LOD) techniques.

11. **UI/UX Design**
    - Design a user-friendly interface for interacting with the graph.
    - Add UI elements like menus, buttons, and information panels.

12. **Testing**
    - Conduct unit tests and integration tests to ensure functionality.
    - Perform user testing to gather feedback and improve usability.

13. **Documentation**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
    - Include setup guides, API documentation, and usage instructions.

14. **Deployment Preparation**
    - Set up hosting for the application (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
    - Configure continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

15. **Initial Deployment**
    - Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
    - Conduct a thorough review and fix any issues identified.

16. **Launch**
    - Deploy the application to the production environment.
    - Announce the launch and provide access to users.

17. **Post-Launch Monitoring**
    - Monitor application performance and user feedback.
    - Address any bugs or issues that arise post-launch.

18. **Ongoing Maintenance**
    - Regularly update the application with new features and improvements.
    - Maintain the backend and ensure data integrity.

19. **Community and Support**
    - Build a community around the KBVE Graph project.
    - Provide support and gather feedback for continuous enhancement.

20. **Future Enhancements**
    - Plan and implement advanced features like collaboration, real-time updates, and AI-driven insights.
    - Continuously improve the user experience based on feedback and technological advancements.
