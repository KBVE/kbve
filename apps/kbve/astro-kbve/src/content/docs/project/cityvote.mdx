## Information

The CityVote game will be a mixture of Civ 1+2 and the Balatro, maybe I should say its a deckbuilder civ game, with a solid automated turn based combat system.
Yet I thought it be interesting to keep game a bit more realtime, with some actual movement and combat happening but also keep a turn based system!
This will be used to help with the interpolation for the realtime.


## Resources

### Gold

-   The economic engine of the whole empire, this will be fundamental for the expansion, we could get a bit more diplomatic with how the gold will work out.

### Food

-   Supply for new units and population happiness.

### Labor

-   Production and the ease of new equipment.

### Faith

-   The religion and reputation of the empire throughout the realm.

### Card Mechanics

| Suit       | Resource        | Function       | Example producers  | Example consumers      |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| ♢ Diamonds | Gold/Wealth     | Economy        | Mine, trade post   | Construction, upgrades |
| ♥ Hearts   | Food/Vitality   | Growth/upkeep  | Farm, mill         | Units, healing         |
| ♠ Spades   | Labor/Force     | Work/Combat    | Workshop, barracks | Crafting, attacks      |
| ♣ Clubs    | Knowledge/Faith | Research/Magic | Library, shrine    | Spells, tech tree      |

### Economic Square

-   Diamonds → fund growth (buy farms/labs)
-   Hearts → sustain population that generates Spades (labor)
-   Spades → construct buildings that produce Clubs (knowledge)
-   Clubs → unlock techs that multiply Diamond output

### AI - 2024


**Rewrite** This information is from Bard and Google.

Cities are complex systems that generate a vast amount of data. 
This data can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of city services, make better decisions about urban planning, and improve the quality of life for citizens.

City data mining is the process of extracting knowledge from this data.
It can be used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that would not be visible to the naked eye. This knowledge can then be used to improve the way cities operate.

City information software is a type of software that is used to collect, store, and analyze city data. It can help cities to manage their data more effectively and to make better use of it.

There are many different types of city information software available. Some of the most common types include:

- **Geographic information systems (GIS)**: GIS software is used to store and visualize spatial data. It can be used to create maps, analyze land use, and track changes to the environment.
- **Sensor networks:** Sensor networks are made up of a large number of sensors that collect data about the environment. This data can be used to monitor things like traffic, air quality, and water levels.
- **Big data analytics:** Big data analytics software is used to analyze large datasets. This software can be used to identify patterns and trends that would not be visible to the naked eye.

City data mining and city information software are powerful tools that can be used to improve the way cities operate. By using these tools, cities can make better decisions about urban planning, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of city services, and improve the quality of life for citizens.

Here are some examples of how city data mining and city information software are being used to improve cities:

-   **Traffic management:** City data mining is being used to improve traffic management. By analyzing data from traffic sensors, cities can identify congested areas and make changes to traffic signals to improve flow.
-   **Public safety:** City data mining is being used to improve public safety. By analyzing data from crime reports, cities can identify crime hotspots and deploy resources more effectively.
-   **Waste management:** City data mining is being used to improve waste management. By analyzing data from trash cans, cities can identify areas where waste is accumulating and make changes to collection schedules.
-   **Public transportation:** City data mining is being used to improve public transportation. By analyzing data from ridership, cities can identify areas where service is needed and make changes to routes or schedules.

These are just a few examples of how city data mining and city information software are being used to improve cities. As these technologies continue to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative ways to use them to make our cities better places to live.



## Notes

The notes for cityvote.com are still a bit out-dated, but I will get back to updating them soon!

## REF

References for the cityvote project have to be updated as well.
