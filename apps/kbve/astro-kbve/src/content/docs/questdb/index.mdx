### Schema

QuestDB's schema, built with tools like Zod for validation, provides a robust framework for defining quests.
The `IQuestSchema` includes fields for unique identifiers (`id`, `guid`), quest metadata (`title`, `description`, `icon`), and gameplay rules (`category`, `hidden`, `repeatable`).
Objectives and rewards are defined via nested schemas, allowing complex quest structures.

For example, a quest in RareIcon might require players to defeat 10 enemies (`IQuestObjectiveSchema`) to unlock a Steam achievement (`IQuestRewardSchema`).
Proper schema design ensures efficient data storage, fast queries, and seamless integration with game logic.
