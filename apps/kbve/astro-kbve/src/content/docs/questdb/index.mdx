<Aside>

QuestDB is an open-source database designed to streamline quest management for games, with seamless Steam integration for achievements and quest tracking.

This guide covers QuestDB's core features, schema structure, and best practices for developers to implement and optimize quest systems in their games.

Utilize this guide to efficiently manage quest data, integrate with Steam, and enhance player engagement through dynamic quest systems.

### Schema

QuestDB's schema, built with tools like Zod for validation, provides a robust framework for defining quests.
The `IQuestSchema` includes fields for unique identifiers (`id`, `guid`), quest metadata (`title`, `description`, `icon`), and gameplay rules (`category`, `hidden`, `repeatable`).
Objectives and rewards are defined via nested schemas, allowing complex quest structures.

For example, a quest in RareIcon might require players to defeat 10 enemies (`IQuestObjectiveSchema`) to unlock a Steam achievement (`IQuestRewardSchema`).
Proper schema design ensures efficient data storage, fast queries, and seamless integration with game logic.
