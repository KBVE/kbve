## SPY

The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (AMEX: SPY) is one of the largest and most liquid exchange-traded funds in the world, tracking the performance of the S&P 500 Index. Launched in 1993, SPY was the first ETF listed in the United States and has become a cornerstone investment for millions of investors seeking broad market exposure.

SPY holds shares of all 500 companies in the S&P 500 index, weighted by market capitalization, providing investors with diversified exposure to large-cap U.S. equities across all sectors. The fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors and has consistently maintained low expense ratios, making it an attractive option for both institutional and retail investors.

## Key Features

SPY provides instant diversification across 500 of the largest U.S. companies, spanning technology, healthcare, financials, consumer discretionary, and other major sectors. This broad exposure helps reduce company-specific risk while maintaining exposure to overall market growth.
