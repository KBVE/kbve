## Item

**Vodka** is a spirit with a purpose.
It's not just for drinking, can be a fuel, a disinfectant, a makeshift Molotov ingredient, or a bribe in the right circles.

Drinking it boosts strength and makes you ignore pain, but at the cost of coordination and clarity.

Distilled in both frozen wastelands and corporate bunkers.
Used in rituals, bartering, and firebombs.

## Lore

> “He drank. The bullet hit. He didn't care. That was the power of vodka.”

Ancient and modern.
Crude and pure. 
Vodka exists in every timeline that dared to ferment.
