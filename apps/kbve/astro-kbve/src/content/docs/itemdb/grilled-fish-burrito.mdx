## Item

The **Grilled Fish Burrito** is dense, delicious, and built to last.
Wrapped in foil and stuffed with flaky grilled fish, fire-roasted peppers, protein-rich beans, and a savory rice blend, it's a balanced battlefield feast.

Ideal for long journeys, power surges, and culinary-based buffs.

## Usage

- Restores **{frontmatter.bonuses.health} health**  
- Grants **+{frontmatter.bonuses.strength} strength** and **+{frontmatter.bonuses.resistance} resistance** for **{frontmatter.scripts[0].vars.duration} seconds**  
- Cooldown: **{frontmatter.cooldown} seconds**

---

## Notes

- Stays warm for hours in foil  
- Consuming next to a campfire gives a 10% bonus to buff duration  
- Can be split and shared (if you're feeling generous)

## Lore

Chefs call it the **Bite of Valor**.

This recipe was developed by Fishfather Raul as a heavy-duty survival meal, packed with nutrients and flavor.
Originally served only during post-storm rebuilds.

> “He once fed a whole rebel squad with three of these and a melted soda. They punched a tank.”  
> - Field Medic Drey, during the 2nd Border Push
