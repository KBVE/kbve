## Item

**Brown Curry Sauce** is a thick and comforting blend used in both field meals and cultural preservation rituals.
Stirred slowly until it becomes one with memory, its spice ignites stamina and sharpens the mind, sometimes too much.
Based on a culinary formula passed down through generations of mech-cooks and memory archivists.

## Lore

> “I tasted it and remembered a lunchbox I never had. And a childhood I might've stolen.”  
> - Diary of a memory-forged mercenary

The sauce speaks to something older than flavor.
Each spice may be a sigil.
Each bite, a glimpse of someone else's life.
