## Item

The **Natural Beeswax** is the golden result of tireless bee labor.
Soft, warm to the touch, and rich with the scent of wildflowers, it's a staple in herbalist recipes and ritual kits.
Harvested from active hives, refined by hand or centrifuge.
Known to hold traces of residual pollen and harmony.

From sealing scrolls to calming salves, it's as versatile as it is fragrant.

Some ancient scrolls were sealed with beeswax so pure, the spells haven't aged a day.
Others use it to muffle weeping spirits.
