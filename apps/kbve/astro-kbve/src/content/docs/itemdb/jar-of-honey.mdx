## Item

The **Jar of Honey** is more than a sweet treat.
Revered by alchemists and wanderers alike, it restores health and stamina while offering versatile applications across culinary, medicinal, and magical fields.

Rumors say a drop of this golden nectar forces even the most cunning liar to pause... and taste their words.


Harvested from [beehives](/itemdb/steel-beehive/) and wild hives.

Processed by apiarists and monks of the Golden Bloom Order.
