## Item

The **Bone** is exactly what it looks like, a fragment of a once-living creature.
It does seem unassuming, but serves many roles: base material for alchemical brews, focus object for dark rituals, or just a joyful chew toy for your loyal dog companion.
Recovered from various remains across battlefields, dig sites, or dinner tables.

It's clean. Mostly.

Just be very careful with bones around them damn neighborhood hell hounds doe and always remember, if the bone don't fit, you must acquit.

## Usage

- Used in **alchemy** for calcium-based reagents and bone powders.
- Great for **pets** , which improves loyalty and mood except some cuties might get scared.
- Small chance of **spiritual echo** (5%) when handled during rituals or full moons.
- Cooldown: None - always throwable.
