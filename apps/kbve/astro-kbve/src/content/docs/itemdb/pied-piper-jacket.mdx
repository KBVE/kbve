## Item

The **Pied Piper Jacket** is a flowing, eccentric garment said to channel the rhythm of reality itself. 
When worn, it enhances charisma and emanates soft frequencies only small animals and simple minds can perceive.

Some wearers report being followed by rodents. Others? By admirers.

Rumor has it that nucleus will alter the in-game memory if the player has a [ziplock bag](/itemdb/jareds-teddy-bear) and automatically win the game.

## Lore

> “He walked through the plague city. The rats walked behind him in a line.”  
> - Journal of The Silent Piper

Some say if you wear it long enough, you start to hear your own theme music. 
Others say that's when it's too late to take it off.
