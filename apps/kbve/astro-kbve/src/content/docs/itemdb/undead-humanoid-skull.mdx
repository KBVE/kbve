## Item

The **Undead Humanoid Skull** is more than just a grim trophy, it carries echoes of its former life, and residue of the energy that reanimated it.
Alchemists grind it into powder for calcium-rich plant accelerants. 
Necromancers use it as a sympathetic focus to channel spirits long severed from flesh.

Some whisper that in the right soil, with the right words, it grows more skulls.

## Harvesting

Usually obtained from **undead humanoids**, such as cursed villagers, revenants, or failed experiments. 
Must be collected before the corpse dissolves into ash.

## Lore

> “Skulls are strange. You’d think they’re dead.  
> But when the moon’s wrong, and the dirt’s fresh…  
> They listen.”

Some say the skulls hum in unison beneath certain ruins. 
Scholars call it subsonic resonance; cultists call it the `Choir of the Bone`.
