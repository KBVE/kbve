## Item

The **Quick Toolbelt** is a no-frills, all-function utility rig.
Worn by veteran engineers, AI tuners, and shipboard mechanics, it contains calibrated torque drivers, micro-welders, and an adaptive nano wrench.

It may not look like much, but seconds saved are systems saved.

## Lore

> “I once saw a guy patch an entire propulsion system mid-reentry with this and a can of sprayfoam. Didn’t *survive*, but the ship did.”

Some belts come with engraved names from past owners—most scratched off, some still glowing faintly with heat.
