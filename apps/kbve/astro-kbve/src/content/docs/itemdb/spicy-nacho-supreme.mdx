## Item

The **Spicy Nacho Supreme** is the go-to snack for rebels needing a quick burst of flavor-fueled courage. Piled high with peppers and secret sauce, it can melt both fear and tastebuds.

Legends say it was first cooked on a scavenged engine block during a long siege. Eat it fast before the cheese solidifies into a chewy shield.
