    A taxidermy kiwi bird stitched atop a grim ceramic mask. 
    Equal parts adorable and unnerving.
    It watches. It judges.

## Item

The **Kiwi Jigsaw** is... difficult to describe politely. 
A plush (or preserved?) kiwi bird sits triumphantly atop a white mask, forever grinning in a rictus smirk.
No one is sure who made it, or why, but the item radiates an aura that makes people pause, squint, and back away slowly?! or laugh until they weep.

Some say it moves when no one is looking.
Others say it whispers riddles in the night.
I say it gives you a reason to uninstall the game because you are a wimp.

You know what, try running a bunch of unsafe [rust](/application/rust/) ffi code inside unsafe [unity](/application/unity/).
Just kidding, you will lose the game, life, even the universe will be gone.

## Lore

> “You ever stare at something so stupid it became brilliant? Yeah. That. But also cursed.”  
> - Cpt. Git, last known owner of the Kiwi Jigsaw

No one's been able to remove the kiwi without breaking something important. Some theorize it's part of a larger... puzzle.
