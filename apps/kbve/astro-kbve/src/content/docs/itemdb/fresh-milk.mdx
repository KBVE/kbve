## Item

**Fresh Milk** is a universally recognized symbol of comfort and sustenance.
Whether chilled from a livestock vault or printed by a synthcow, its creamy texture refreshes the body and soothes the soul.

Can be used in rituals, recipes, or simply enjoyed with cookies (if you still believe in them).

Can be extracted from clean livestock or synthesized via nano-dairy replicators.

Standard milk has to be approved by KBVE Culinary Standards Division.

> “She poured it over the ritual circle. It hissed. Then... quiet.”

Ancient farmers believed milk was the last gift of peace before chaos returned.
That belief stuck. Somehow, it still works.
