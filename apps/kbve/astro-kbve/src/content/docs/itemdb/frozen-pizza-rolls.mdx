## Item

**Frozen Pizza Rolls** are the ultimate paradox: too cold to eat, too hot to handle, and somehow always slightly overcooked in one corner. 
Despite that, or maybe because of it, they're beloved by scavengers, students, and survivors alike.

Eat them frozen in desperation, or cook them for better buffs and a lower chance of tongue incineration.

They are a culinary relic from the late Plastonomy Age. 
Found in frozen bunkers, old vending rigs, or deep freezer caches.

## Lore

> “Every single bite is either frozen solid or hotter than a reactor core. There is no in-between. Only love.”

Once a mass-market snack, now a ration-treat of nostalgic power. 
Some claim eating one helps recall your childhood... or last week's regrets.
