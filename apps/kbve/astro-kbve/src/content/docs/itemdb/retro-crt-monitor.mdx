## Item

The **Retro CRT Monitor** is a boxy, radiation hugging relic.
Despite its weight and humming backplate, it still boots. And when it does, it renders systems in crisp blocky fonts with command-line loyalty.

Perfect for running shell-based software, decoding vintage data chips, or watching corrupted public service announcements from before the Collapse.

## Usage

- Grants **terminal access** to classic shell systems  
- Renders **8-bit data interfaces** with minimal lag  
- Slight **glitch resistance** when connected to unstable networks  
- May unlock **hidden retro OS overlays** or AI logs

---

## Notes

- Emits low-level magnetic field but keep this away from synthetic pets  
- Compatible with: `datapad-modem`, `shell-core`, and `relic floppy drives`  
- Makes a satisfying *"thunk"* when turned on

## Lore

> “The screen blinked. Static, then green text. It said: _'Hello again.'_”  
> - Field tech log recovered from Vault 404

Many believe these monitors never truly shut off.
That the last message always waits to be read in 8-bit purgatory.
