description: | 
    A tattered manual on the undoing of the invincible.
    It reads like both scripture and strategy.
    The margins are deeply unnerving.

## Item

The **Kryptonite Book** is bound in leather-like matter and inked with anti-symbols and sacred geometry.
It outlines speculative strategies on dismantling "super humans"—beings forged by radiation, prophecy, or cosmic lineage.

Its tone is surgical, reverent, and bitter.
The final chapter is sealed with wax, and labeled “He Who Walks Between Cross and Cape.”

Found sealed beneath a collapsed cathedral vault.
Digitally preserved and redacted by KBVE Occult Archives.
Not recognized by any official doctrine or heroic registry.

- Cannot be copied. May **trigger hallucinations** when read aloud
