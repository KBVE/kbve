## Item

The **Fish Taco** is a handheld culinary wonder.
Grilled fish, zesty cabbage, and a spicy mayo drizzle all wrapped in a slightly charred tortilla.
It is simple, satisfying, and somehow makes your fingers move faster.

Perfect for adventurers who need both nutrition and a slight edge in battle but not stealth.


A legendary taco, `Fish Taco Ultra`, which is fried fish, veggies and folded by the legendary food vendor Raul “Two-Hand” Velez.
Crafted during the Crossbay Riots but the recipe was lost to time, thus the **Fish Taco** is a humble homage to that legendary dish.

## Lore

> “He handed it to me as the drones fired tear gas. Said: 'Even the end of the world needs flavor.'”  
> - Street Survivor's Memoirs, Vol. 3

Some say the original recipe was taught by a seafaring AI chef who only spoke in spice levels.
