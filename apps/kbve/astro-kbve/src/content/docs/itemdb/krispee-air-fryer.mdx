## Item

The **Krispee Air Fryer** is a legendary kitchen appliance often revered more as a relic than a tool.
Capable of perfectly crisping anything from mystery meat to neutron noodles, it even emits faint hums reminiscent of forgotten sitcom jingles.

It’s rumored that food cooked within retains a trace of soul… and crunch.

## Lore

> “We fried a ghost shrimp in it. Tasted like memory and butter.”  
> – Field Cook Ro, final transmission before flavor-induced coma.

It’s said that every Krispee Air Fryer carries the burnt-in scent of its first meal.
Some have tried to erase it.
None have succeeded.
