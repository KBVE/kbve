## Item

The **Pocket Prophet of Profit** is a tarnished golden idol small enough to fit in your hand, though doing so comes with whispers of premonitions and market anomalies. 
Legends claim it was smuggled out during the final minutes of an infamous financial collapse, clutching secrets that could predict futures… or end them.
Rumor has it that it was once owned by a Darth Dick, vice president from an imperial empire located in a far far far away galaxy.
