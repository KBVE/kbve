## Item

The **VHS Tape** is a relic of a slower, stranger time.
Covered in dust and labeled in smeared inkâ€”or not at allâ€”it hums with analog life when inserted into a working player.
What's on it? A cartoon? A manifesto? 
A final message from the past?

You won't know until you press play.

- Stackable and archivable in data vaults

## Lore

> "It played. But the shadows didn't match the people on screen."
> - Note taped to the back of a working player, left on pause

Collectors say the static carries emotion. Archivists say don't play the ones that rewind themselves.
