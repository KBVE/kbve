## Item

The **VHS Tape** is a relic of a slower, stranger time.
Covered in dust and labeled in smeared ink—or not at all—it hums with analog life when inserted into a working player.
What's on it? A cartoon? A manifesto? 
A final message from the past?

You won't know until you press play.

## Usage

- Playable on **VHS-capable devices** or **analog terminal decks**  
- May trigger **cutscenes**, **memories**, or **fear status**  
- Has a **20% chance** to produce **signal distortion or audio bleed**  
- Stackable and archivable in data vaults

## Known Contents (sample rolls)

- 🔹 *Home Video - Birthday 89* (cuts to static mid-cake)  
- 🔹 *Do Not Watch* (rewound to 00:01)  
- 🔹 *Local Channel News - May 12, 1991* (looped emergency broadcast)

## Lore

> "It played. But the shadows didn't match the people on screen."
> - Note taped to the back of a working player, left on pause

Collectors say the static carries emotion. Archivists say don't play the ones that rewind themselves.
