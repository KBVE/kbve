## Item

The **Data CD** appears like any old Blu-ray disc—until you scan it.
The laser loops endlessly, never hitting the same pattern twice.
With its multi-dimensional encoding, this CD holds simulations, archives, full planetary scans, and forgotten AI constructs.

No one's ever seen it full. Some say it reflects your thoughts. Others say it writes them down.

## Usage

- Holds **infinite digital data**, stored in layered quantum lattices  
- Compatible with advanced **quantum readers**, legacy disc trays (poorly), and **neural uplinks** (dangerous)  
- 10% chance to **trigger an emotional memory leak** during playback  
- Stackable, but each disc is uniquely etched — no duplicates

---

## Known Contents (when scanned)

- *Backup of a failed AI uprising*  
- *Map of a city that does not exist anymore*  
- *Complete philosophical works of 90,000 authors, including yourself*  
- *Encrypted. Unreadable. Still warm.*

## Lore

> “They said optical storage was dead. Then someone built a library that bent time using only 32 discs and a mirror.”  
> - Archivist Rau, Deep Spindle Node

Some say you don't find the data and that it finds you. 
Especially if you stare at the disc too long.
