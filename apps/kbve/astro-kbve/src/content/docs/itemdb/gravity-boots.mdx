## Item

**Gravity Boots** allow quick vertical maneuvers and effortless ceiling strolls.
Originally designed for station repairs, they found their way into daring expeditions and flashy heists.

Their thrusters hum softly, adjusting magnetic grip as you step.

## Usage

- Grants **enhanced mobility** with {frontmatter.bonuses.mobility} speed levels
- Negates **fall damage** when active
- Activates **zero-G control** for {frontmatter.scripts[0].vars.duration} seconds per use
- Cooldown: **{frontmatter.cooldown} seconds**

---

## Notes

- Requires periodic recharging with standard power cells
- Overuse may trigger security scanners in restricted zones

## Lore

> "With these on, up and down are just suggestions."
> - Graffiti near the old orbital docks

Once reserved for elite zero-gravity units, surplus pairs now circulate among smugglers and explorers.
