## Item

**Jareds Teddy Bear** is not a bear at all. 
This curio is a ziplock bag kinda sealed, stuffed with brittle newspaper clippings and topped with a smiley face drawn in black permanent marker. 
There's a warmth to it... even if the warmth is mostly from your pity.

Still, it worked for Jared. 
And maybe it'll work for you.
Wait... was it Jareds or Donalds teddy bear.

## Lore

> "It was actually a ziploc bag filled with newspaper that I drew a smiley face on"
> - Jared from Silicon Valley, Season 3 Episode 7?.

Some say the bear listens. Others say it remembers. Either way, no one ever throws it away.
