## Item

**Vampire Blood Champagne** is not merely a drink, it is an experience. 
This sparking wine fanged fizz fills your soul with warmth, your cheeks with allure, and briefly, your cells with immortality. 
Served at only the most decadent of occult celebrations.

A celebratory drink crafted only during lunar eclipses in crypt-wineries.
Said to contain the blood of a noble vampire line.

Just do not ask the vampires to bring you any humans from their kitchen.
