## Item

**Gin** is not a drink for warriors but rather a diplomat's dagger in a glass.
Infused with fragrant botanicals and fermented regrets, it sharpens social instincts while fraying the veil between truths.
Crafted in copper coils by botanists and liars. 
A staple of dystopian salons and rebel diplomats. 

Best sipped when plotting, deceiving, or seducing intel.
