## Item

The **Punk Skateboard** is a statement as much as a tool. 
Worn stickers, welded trucks, neon tape. It's meant to be loud and fast. 
When equipped, it gives you a burst of rebellious speed and unpredictability—perfect for evading cops, parkouring across rooftops, or crashing a political rally in style.

Popularized in the Undercity Riot Races. 
Wheels salvaged from a drone courier.
