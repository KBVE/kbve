title: 'Propagandist Laptop'
description: |
    An outdated laptop brimming with influence campaigns and forgotten scripts. The fan runs louder when lies are typed.
    Why does it keep saying that it runs arch? Oh god, its update is several exa-holy-bytes, are those just node modules?!

## Item

The **Propagandist Laptop** is an orange [unix](/application/linux/), sticker-ridden relic from another info-war.
Damn keyboard emits heat, not just from overuse but from the stories it rewrites.
Whether it's election meddling or uncovering state secrets, this machine was built to bend narratives.

Its terminal runs deep into the darknet, the archive, and the firewalls of weast korea.

## Usage

- Boosts **influence** and **hack power** by {frontmatter.bonuses.influence} and {frontmatter.bonuses.hackPower} respectively
- Activates **{frontmatter.bonuses.stealthScripts ? 'stealth scripts' : 'basic logging only'}** for covert ops
- Cooldown: **{frontmatter.cooldown} seconds**

---

## Recovery

It is often recovered in abandoned war rooms, fake news bunkers, or sealed diplomatic pouches. No two contain the same data—each has a history.

## Lore

> “I opened a ZIP file labeled ‘truth.exe’. Two regimes collapsed and my cat won a local election.”
