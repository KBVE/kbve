## Item

The **Spooky Skull Candle** is both decorative and functional waxy flame cradled within the hollowed-out top of a [humanoid skull](/itemdb/undead-humanoid-skull/).
The candle burns with a quiet red hue and flickers when unseen presences draw near.
Oh the skull can detect lesser magical entities that are within the distance, foreshadowing the evil demons.

It doesn't repel evil... but it knows when it't watching you, think of it as the TSA for the necromancy spirits.

Crafted by Grave Wax Artisans using ethically sourced bone remnants and enchanted bee wax.
Spirit warning flicker tuned to spectral level-1 resonance.

## Usage

- Provides **light** in a radius of {frontmatter.bonuses.lightRadius} meters
- Flickers when **lesser evil spirits** are nearby
- Can be held, placed, or mounted on altars
- Cooldown: **{frontmatter.cooldown} seconds**


---

## Detection Logic

Spirit flicker triggers on:
- Nearby **Level 1-2** spiritual entities
- Dormant undead awaiting activation
- Cursed ground or unmarked grave miasma

---

## Lore

> “Don't trust the light. Trust the flicker.”  
> - Note carved beneath an old mausoleum

When the candle flickers twice and the flame leans sideways, you're not alone. When it blows itself out… you were too late.
