## Item

The **Rebel Radio** is a cobbled-together shortwave transmitter modified with encryption bypassers and frequency faders.
When activated, it pings secret nodes, some respond with supplies, some with intel, and others just hiss with static.

Its antenna hums when the regime gets close.

Soldered together from salvaged warband comms, banned ham rigs, and a hope-fueled battery.
Broadcast range limited by orbital interference.

## Usage

- Broadcasts on **rebel, encrypted, and low-orbit frequencies**  
- **20% chance** to call in **rebel support** (supply drop, distraction, intel ping)  
- Generates a **local jamming field**, disrupting enemy sensors and drones  
- Cooldown: **{frontmatter.cooldown} seconds**

---

## Strategic Use

Use during:
- **Sieges or extractions**  
- **Data heist missions**  
- **Rebel-aligned event chains**

Works best when elevated or near power amplifiers.

## Lore

> “The revolution won't be televised. But it will be broadcast, encoded, and bounced off an abandoned satellite on Channel 42069.”  
> - Signal Jacker `K`

Some say the radio responds even when it's off.
Others say that's just paranoia. 
But it does blink... sometimes.
