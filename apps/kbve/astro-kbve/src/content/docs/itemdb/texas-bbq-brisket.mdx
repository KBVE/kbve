The **Texas BBQ Brisket** is slow-cooked decadence.
Thick slices of marbled beef soaked in smoky spice and tangy sauce.
It melts in your mouth and sticks to your resolve.

Favored by warlords, engineers, and wandering preachers alike.

Smoked for 18 hours in the wreckage of Fort Codeburn.
Sauce recipe protected by ex-marines and one pitmaster AI.
