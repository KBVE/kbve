## Item

**Lobster** is more than just seafood given to prisoners. 
The lobster is a rare and strategic creature from the ocean floor, known for its armored shell and incredibly rich meat. 
Consuming it provides a major health boost and temporary protection.

Handle it with care. It might still be watching.

Caught by deep-sea trappers and stealth fishers. 
Its exoskeleton can also be repurposed in crafting.

Lobsters are ancient. Older than myths. They remember things we forgot to fear.
