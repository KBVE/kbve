## Item

The **Steel Beehive** is a modern, reinforced apiary system designed for environments where wooden hives would rot, warp, or be stolen by raccoons.
Once deployed, it attracts a micro-colony of hyper-adapted bees that generate **honey** and **beeswax** in fixed harvest cycles.

Its humming sound is strangely therapeutic, though the manual warns against sleeping beside it.

## Usage

- Produces **{frontmatter.bonuses.honeyYield} honey** and **{frontmatter.bonuses.waxYield} beeswax** every {frontmatter.bonuses.harvestInterval} seconds
- Compatible with **crafting stations** for:
  - **Candles** (wax) by using [Natural Beeswax](/itemdb/natural-beeswax/)
  - **Mead** (honey) by using [Jar of Honey](/itemdb/jar-of-honey/)
  - **Medicine** (both)
- Durable and **reusable** in most biomes

---

## Placement Notes

Place near wildflowers or crops for boosted output.
Do not place in snow unless bees are rated for cryo-environments (sold separately).

## Lore

> “Where there is honey, there was once war. But now, sweetness.”  
> - Agronomancer Teth, Treaty of Nectar Fields

Legends speak of a beehive made of pure silver - but steel is safer, and doesn't melt during solar flares or by jet fuel.
