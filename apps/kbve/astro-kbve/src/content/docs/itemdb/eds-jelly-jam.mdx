## Item

**Ed's Jelly Jam** is a syrupy, chaotic spread known for waking people up and confusing small machines.
Slather it on bread, drop it into a stew, or sip it like forbidden wine.

It's sticky and energetic, hint of flora and hibiscus, then you know it's Eddies.

Made in a solar-powered food truck from synthetic grapes or whatever was growing near the anomaly field.

## Lore

Legends say Ed once powered a motorbike with this jam.
No one has disproven it.
