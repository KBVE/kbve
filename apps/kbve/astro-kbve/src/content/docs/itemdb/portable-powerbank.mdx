## Item

The **Portable Powerbank** is a rugged, handheld energy source that recharges up to two devices or machines simultaneously.
Outfitted with overcharge protection (sort of) and built from hardened composite casing, it's a lifeline in power scarce situations.

It hums like it remembers what electricity used to feel like.

Designed by ReCharge Industries before grid failure protocols.
Used by explorers, field medics, and rogue AI cultists.

## Usage

- Restores **{frontmatter.bonuses.energyRestore} energy** per charge  
- Connects to up to **{frontmatter.bonuses.chargeSlots} devices**  
- 5% chance to **overheat**, causing minor burn or tool misfire  
- Cooldown: **{frontmatter.cooldown} seconds**

---

## Compatible Targets

- Power tools  
- Surveillance drones  
- Emergency terminals  
- Synthwave cassette players (untested)

## Lore

> “Battery's full. You're not. Rest later.”  
> - OldField Operator Manual, pg. 7

Some say if you hold it long enough, it pulses in rhythm with your heart.
Others say that's the capacitor failing.
