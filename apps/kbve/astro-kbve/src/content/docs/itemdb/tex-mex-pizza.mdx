## Item

The **Tex-Mex Pizza** is a food anomaly as a culinary riot of salsa, cheese, crushed red chips, hot sauce, and sweet regret all baked onto a slightly burnt tortilla crust.

Perfect for rebels with no time for cutlery and a death wish for spice.
Originally a midnight dare during a kitchen blackout. Now a comfort meal in every rebel camp.

## Notes

- Attracts critters, rebels, and very brave dogs

## Lore

> “Was it good? No. Was it hot? Yes. Did I eat the whole thing? Also yes.”  
> - Anonymous rebel before the Last Alley Dash

Every rebel group has their version.
All of them swear theirs is the worst.
And that is why it is the best.
