## Item

The **Microchip Motherboard** is a high-density, modular logic board once used in pre-collapse computing systems. 
Now it's a vital piece in restoring lost tech, whether it be upgrading bots, reviving derelict AI, or overclocking a mobile terminal.

Manufactured in limited batches through uv light exposed to silicon waffers.
Recovered from derelict tech labs, crashed drones, and smart-toasters gone rogue.

Its traces glow faintly when near electromagnetic fields... or strong memories.

Psychotic once said, we chasing the rush of trying to decipher the code a decade later.

## Usage

- Increases **processing capability** by {frontmatter.bonuses.processingPower} units
- Compatible with: **{frontmatter.bonuses.systemCompat}**
- Has minor **heat sensitivity** — avoid unstable power sources
- Stackable in **drone fabrication**, **robot brain slots**, and **terminal sockets**

---

## Crafting Integration

Used in advanced blueprints for:
- **Z90 MurderBot AI core**
- **Field repair terminals**
- **Sensor modules**
- **Autonomous harvest drones**

## Lore

> “They say the first one was grown, not soldered. Every board since is a poor imitation of the original dream.”

Some engineers believe if you align five boards under a blood moon, they boot into something... conscious.
