## Item

The **Rubber Tire** is a classic, rugged loop of flexible material once central to ground-based travel.
Now, it's a multi-purpose item used in **transport chassis**, **obstacle courses**, and sometimes just **burned for warmth or smoke cover**.

It creaks when rolled. Thuds when thrown. Smells faintly like apocalypse mixed with asphalt and a hint of ozone depletion.

Recovered from junkyards, burnt-out cars, and forgotten racing arenas.

## Usage

- **Crafting uses**: vehicles, carts, makeshift armor, smog signals  
- Can be **burned** in furnaces or fire traps 
- Has **bounce factor** useful in physics interactions or trap designs  
- Stackable, durable, and easy to roll in all meanings

## Salvage Yields

When broken down:
- **Rubber scraps**
- **Steel cords**
- Possible **char residue**

## Lore

> “Tires are the cockroaches of civilization—ugly, everywhere, and they just… don't… rot.”  
> - Scrap Queen Holla, Wheel Cultist

In some wastelands, they worship tires.
In others, they use them to fuel the fire that burns those cultists out.
