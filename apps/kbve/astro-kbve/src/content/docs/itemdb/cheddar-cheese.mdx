## Item

**Cheddar Cheese** is bold, confident, and beautifully orange.
It's not just food, it's a core ingredient. 
Whether sliced for a ration board or melted into a rebel lasagna, it restores the body and slightly lifts the mood of any merchant who respects flavor.

Aged deep within bunker cellars or luxury fridge pods. 
Loved by rats, kings, hackers, and chefs.

Made with [fresh milk](/itemdb/fresh-milk/).
