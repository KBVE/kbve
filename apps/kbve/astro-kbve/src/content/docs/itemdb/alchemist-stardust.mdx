## Item

The **Alchemist Stardust** is more than matter, we believe it to be an equation.
Composed of liberated quarks, neutron scatter, and photonic debris, each grain of dust vibrates along the fifth axis: *energy*.

Forged not in stars, but in the *remnants* of their death , white holes, the mythical ejecta of black hole convergence.
Some armchair scientists claim the dust emerges through wormholes lined with gamma radiation, others say it forms wherever time hiccups.

Either way, its properties are stable in 5D.

## Usage

-   Used in **high tier alchemical crafting**, quantum catalysts, or 5D simulacra
-   Attuned to a **{frontmatter.bonuses.elementAffinity} affinity rating** with prime elements
-   Resonates with **time harmonics** and energy constants
-   Cooldown: N/A - passive reactive material

---

## Harvesting

Only gatherable via gravitic siphons near wormhole throats or with neutron netting during white hole surges. 
Impossible to synthesize fully, only isolate.

## Lore

> “We ran the five dimensional integral: ∫∫∫∫∫ dx·dy·dz·dt·de  
> The solution wasn’t a number. It was music.”

> "Untouchable strings from a spacetime orchestra."
