## Item

The **Auto Cooker 9000** isn't just a kitchen appliance, it's a culinary AI assistant.
Once deployed, it scans nearby ingredients and recipes, enhances meal stats, and may even uncover secret cooking bonuses tied to item lore or planetary effects.

Feeding the auto cooker 9000 [VHS Tapes](/itemdb/vhs-tape/), [Data CDs](/itemdb/data-cd/) or [Microchip Motherboards](/itemdb/microchip-motherboard/) might give it upgrades.

Developed by ByteKitchen Systems.
Reverse-engineered from a crashed alien food drone and reprogrammed with culinary AI.
