## Item

**Vodka Sauce** is what happens when comfort food meets reckless science.
The creamy tomato base is laced with just enough ethanol to trigger warmth or combustion, depending on use.

Best served over noodles. Or flung at cursed entities.

Sauce recipe recovered from the pre-Fall culinary databanks. 
Labeled as “Spaghetti but Dangerous.” 

Made with mixing both [tomato pasta sauce](/itemdb/tomato-pasta-sauce/) and [vodka](/itemdb/vodka/).
