## Item

**Ink Pasta Sauce** is a shadow in a jar.
Created from deep-sea creatures and darker culinary secrets, this sauce enhances stealth and grants night vision, but might ping something ancient beneath the waves.
First crafted in submarine kitchens, then smuggled into surface cuisine. 
The sauce whispers back if eaten in silence.
