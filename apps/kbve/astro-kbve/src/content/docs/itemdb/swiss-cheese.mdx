## Item

The **Swiss Cheese** is more than a snack, it's a conversation starter with rodents and a trusted ration of wandering scholars.
Aged to perfection, it improves mental clarity (briefly), though it might summon an audience you didn't ask for.

Aged beneath the Alps or replicated in orbital dairy stations.
KBVE Culinary Division classifies it as "edible and stable."

Made from [fresh milk](/itemdb/fresh-milk/) or using modified milk.

## Lore

> “Every hole in the cheese is a memory. Eat too many and you remember someone else's past.”  
> - The Cheeselord, Issue 3

Some say the holes align when placed under moonlight. Others say that's nonsense. No one agrees. Everyone eats.
