## Item

The **Herbal Medi-Wrap** is a simple but potent first-aid item.
A soft bandage wrapping that contains crushed herbs and forest salves that gently close wounds and reduce bleeding over time.
Favored by explorers, scouts, and healers who trust leaves over labs.

Crafted by field medics and forest apothecaries using mossweave cloth, wild herbs, and [beeswax](/itemdb/natural-beeswax/) binder.

Its smell alone brings peace and its effect brings you home.

Some healers whisper that each wrap carries a spirit of the grove it was gathered from.
Fold it three times, and it will remember the hands that made it.
