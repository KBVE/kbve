## Item

The **Anime Body Pillow** is a long, plush rectangle of suspiciously soft synthetic material, printed with a character whose legal rights were probably lost in the Great Licensing Wars.
One side is cheerful. The other is intense.

Used for morale restoration, naps, or... "companionship."
Handle with emotional gloves.

Mass-produced before the Fall, personalized post-Fandom Collapse.
Fabric recovered from Expo Ruins.

## Usage

- Grants **+{frontmatter.bonuses.moraleBoost} morale**  
- Improves **sleep quality** and shortens **panic/fear cooldowns**  
- May influence dreams with **"anime-tagged memory states"**  
- Emits a soft aura of **synthetic warmth** and dried tears

---

## Notes

- Not suitable for combat. Probably.  
- Reactions vary from NPCs - admiration, mockery, envy, confusion.  
- Wash carefully. Some characters resist detergent.

## Lore

> - Sleep Pod 04 survivor, post-Broadcast Silence

Some say hugging the pillow too long syncs your heart rate with hers.
Some say it starts talking back.
Either way, you sleep better.
