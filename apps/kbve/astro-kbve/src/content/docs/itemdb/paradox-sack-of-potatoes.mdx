## Item

The **Paradox Sack of Potatoes** seems like an ordinary bundle of earthy nourishment, yet holding it feels… off. 
As if reality hiccups for a moment. 
Consuming it restores vitality and something stranger.
Would make for an interesting and perplexing ingredient for a cozy meal, maybe fish n chips.
Wait did that fish just talk?!
