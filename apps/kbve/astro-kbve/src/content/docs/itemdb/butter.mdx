## Item

**Butter** is the foundation of decadence and alchemy. 
Whether used to baste meat, bind potions, or grease a hatch, its texture and taste are both beloved and powerful.

It's also been used to escape handcuffs. Just saying.

[Fresh milk](/itemdb/fresh-milk/) churned in ancient barrels or synthetically replicated via protein printers.
A base component in countless dishes, like [Lobster Soup](/itemdb/lobster-soup/).
