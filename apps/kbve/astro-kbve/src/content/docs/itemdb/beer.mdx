## Item

**Beer** is the beverage of warriors, farmers, space traders, and everyone between. 
Brewed with care and consumed with questionable judgment, it adds strength, reduces shame, and pairs well with questionable decisions.

Also brewed everywhere from back-alley barrels to floating breweries in the cloud districts.

## Lore

> “After the third one, I told her about the cursed sword. After the sixth… I used it.”  
> - Field notes of Captain Lorik

Beer is more than a drink. It's a truth serum in a cozy disguise.
During the Lunar Harvest Festival, master brewers challenge one another to craft
"starlight ale" that glows faintly under the night sky, guiding travelers back
to the tavern.
