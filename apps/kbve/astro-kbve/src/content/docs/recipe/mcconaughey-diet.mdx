## McConaughey's Mediterranean Diet

[Check out this Insider Post on the Matthew McConaughey's Diet for the Dallas Buyer's Club](https://www.insider.com/matthew-mcconaughey-lost-50lbs-for-dallas-buyers-club-on-diet-2020-10). Matthew McConaughey lost 50 pounds on the Mediterranean diet. Guess he wanted to be 'McCona-slim' instead of 'McCona-hey'! I guess he proved that 'abs'olutely anything is possible! McConaughey's diet also allowed him to eat cheese and yogurt in moderation. Talk about 'dairying' his way to a healthier lifestyle!

### What is the Mediterranean Diet?

The Mediterranean diet is all about balance, like enjoying wine in moderation.
It's like saying, 'I'll have a glass, but I won't whine!' It's all about fish and seafood. I guess it's a 'scale' of flavors for McConaughey!
The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating based on the traditional cuisine of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
While there is no single definition of the Mediterranean diet, it is typically high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nut and seeds, and olive oil. The Mediterranean diet emphasizes olive oil.
No wonder McConaughey's weight loss plan was 'olive oil' smooth! With all those vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, the Mediterranean diet is like a 'sea' of healthy choices.
McConaughey sailed through it!
Another big component to this particular diet is the consumption of fish and seafood at least a couple times a week.
Poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt can be eaten in moderation. Meanwhile, red meat is eaten only occasionally.
Red wine in moderation is recommended on the Mediterranean diet. It's like the diet's way of saying, 'Wine not?'

### What kind of wine should I drink?

The Mediterranean diet typically allows red wine in moderation.
Red wine is high in antioxidants and has been linked to a wide range of health benefits.
However, keep in mind that drinking too much alcohol can have harmful effects.
According to my buddy, [Malbec Wine](https://winefolly.com/deep-dive/what-is-malbec-wine/) pairs best with this diet.
Looks like McConaughey found the 'red' path to weight loss! However, pairing a red wine with a meal is a very personal choice.
If you're not a fan of Malbec, don't worry.
You can still 'wine' and dine with a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Merlot. Choices, choices!
