## Equipment Info

The Tonalztics of ralos is a powerful ranged weapon obtained from the Fortis Colosseum. This uncharged version requires 75 Ranged to wield and serves as one of the best-in-slot throwing weapons in Old School RuneScape.

**Weapon Type:** Thrown
**Attack Speed:** 7 (same as longbow)

## Stats

| Stat | Bonus |
|------|-------|
| Ranged Attack | +115 |
| Ranged Strength | +55 |
| Prayer | +2 |

## Special Attack

**Division** (50% special attack energy)

The special attack reduces the target's Defence by 10% of their Magic level with each hit. This makes it particularly effective against high-Magic opponents in PvP and certain PvM encounters.

## Charging

The Tonalztics of ralos can be charged using Sunfire splinters:

- **Maximum Charges:** 20,000
- **Material Required:** Sunfire splinters (Item ID: 28924)
- **Charged Version:** Tonalztics of ralos (charged) (Item ID: 28922)

When charged, the weapon gains additional power and hits twice per attack, making it significantly more effective.

## Usage

Best uses for the Tonalztics of ralos:

- High-level bossing where Defence reduction is valuable
- PvP encounters against mages
- Fortis Colosseum speed runs
- General ranged combat with prayer bonus

**Note:** The uncharged version only hits once. Charge with Sunfire splinters for double hits.

## Market Strategy

**Buy Limit:** 8 per 4 hours
**Estimated Price:** ~44.2M GP

**Tips:**
- Price fluctuates based on Colosseum popularity
- Sunfire splinters needed for charging add to total cost
- Consider buying during off-peak hours
- Check charged version price for comparison
