## Equipment Info

The Tome of earth (empty) is a magic off-hand item dropped by The Hueycoatl boss. It is the uncharged version of the Tome of earth and requires 50 Magic to equip.

**Slot:** Shield/Off-hand
**Weight:** 1.0 kg
**Tradeable:** Yes

## Stats

| Stat | Bonus |
|------|-------|
| Magic Attack | +8 |
| Magic Defence | +8 |

**Note:** The empty tome provides only the base stats. To gain the earth spell damage bonus and infinite earth runes effect, you must charge it with Soiled pages.

## Charging

To activate the tome's full potential, you need to charge it:

- **Charging Material:** Soiled page
- **Maximum Charges:** 20,000
- **Charged Version:** Tome of earth (ID: 30064)

Each Soiled page adds charges to the tome. When charged, the tome transforms into the active Tome of earth.

## Obtaining

Dropped by The Hueycoatl with a 1/90 drop rate.

## Usage

The empty tome is primarily used as:
- A stepping stone to the charged Tome of earth
- Budget magic off-hand for players who cannot afford pages
- Investment item for charging and reselling

**Recommendation:** Charge the tome with Soiled pages to unlock the 10% earth spell damage boost and infinite earth runes effect.

## Market Strategy

**Buy Limit:** 8 per 4 hours
**Estimated Price:** ~366K GP

**Tips:**
- Price gap between empty and charged version indicates page value
- Consider buying empty tomes when Hueycoatl is heavily farmed
- Empty tomes are more liquid than charged versions
- Compare cost of charging vs buying pre-charged
