## About

The gilded kiteshield is a cosmetic variant of the rune kiteshield with identical stats but a prestigious golden appearance. It requires 40 Defence to wear.

Gilded armour is obtained from Treasure Trails and is valued for its appearance rather than stats. It shares the same defensive bonuses as rune armour but costs significantly more due to its rarity and fashionscape appeal.

## Market Strategy

**Investment Notes:**
- Price driven by cosmetic demand
- Popular for fashionscape and showing off
- More accessible than 3rd age but still valuable

**Trading Tips:**
- Compare prices with rune equivalent for value assessment
- Watch for dips after clue scroll events
- Popular with free-to-play players for fashion
