## About

The gilded scimitar is a cosmetic variant of the rune scimitar with identical stats but a prestigious golden appearance. It requires 40 Attack to wield.

Gilded weapons are obtained from Treasure Trails and are valued for their appearance rather than stats. The gilded scimitar shares the same offensive bonuses as a rune scimitar but costs significantly more due to its rarity and fashionscape appeal.

## Market Strategy

**Investment Notes:**
- Price driven by cosmetic demand
- Popular for fashionscape and showing off
- Great for free-to-play pking fashion

**Trading Tips:**
- Compare prices with rune equivalent for value assessment
- Watch for dips after clue scroll events
- Popular with free-to-play players for fashion
