## About

The 3rd age full helmet is part of the 3rd age melee set, one of the rarest and most prestigious armour sets in Old School RuneScape. It requires 65 Defence to wear and provides stats comparable to a rune full helm but with superior aesthetics.

3rd age equipment is highly sought after due to its extreme rarity and status symbol value. It can only be obtained from Treasure Trails, specifically from master clue scroll caskets at an exceptionally low drop rate.

## Market Strategy

- Extremely valuable due to rarity
- Price fluctuates based on collector demand
- Consider set value vs individual pieces
