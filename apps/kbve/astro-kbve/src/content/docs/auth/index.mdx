## Privacy & Security

<Aside type="tip">
Your authentication is handled securely through Supabase with industry-standard encryption.
</Aside>

Your data is protected:

- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- OAuth providers (GitHub, Discord) follow industry-standard security practices
- Your session data is encrypted and stored locally using IndexedDB
- You can sign out at any time from the [logout page](/auth/logout)

## Need Help?

If you're experiencing issues with authentication, try:

1. Clearing your browser cache and cookies
2. Signing out completely and signing back in
3. Checking that third-party cookies are enabled for OAuth providers
