## What's Happening?

When you sign out, we ensure your session is completely removed:

1. **Clear your session** from the authentication bridge
2. **Delete session data** from IndexedDB
3. **Remove tokens** from localStorage
4. **Redirect you** to the home page

<Aside type="tip">
Signing out on one device does not affect sessions on other devices.
</Aside>

## Your Data is Safe

Signing out removes your authentication session from this browser, but:

- Your account data remains safely stored on our servers
- You can sign back in anytime to resume where you left off
- Your profile at `kbve.com/@username` remains accessible
- Your linked accounts (Discord, GitHub) stay connected

## Sign Back In
