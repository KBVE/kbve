# Silver Vein

A luminous vein of silver ore interwoven with quartz filaments. Prospectors often find these veins near moonlit cliffs and
glacial ravines where the air carries a crisp metallic scent.

## Mining Notes
- Requires steel pickaxe or imbued mining focus
- Harvest cycles return 6 silver ore and occasional quartz shards
- Shorter cooldown between harvests compared to denser metals
- Known to sparkle at night, making them easier to scout from afar

## Crafting Applications
- Refined into argentum ingots for spell-reflective armor
- Essential for minting high-value currency and sigil cores
- Blended with herbs for potent alchemical catalysts

## Lore
Ancient travelers claim silver veins trace celestial pathways, aligning with the full moon and guiding explorers toward hidden
shrines carved into the mountainside.
