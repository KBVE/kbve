# Redwood Tree

A towering redwood tree that reaches high into the sky. These ancient giants provide significantly more wood than common trees but are less common in the wild.

## Harvesting Notes
- Requires basic axe
- Yields 10 wood per harvest
- Takes longer to harvest due to size
- Less common spawn (20% chance compared to oak)
