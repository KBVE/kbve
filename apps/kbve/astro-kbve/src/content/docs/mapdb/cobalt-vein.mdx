# Cobalt Vein

An elusive cobalt-rich deposit that pulses with a faint electric glow. These veins nestle deep in volcanic strata and are
coveted by artificers for their conductive properties.

## Mining Notes
- Requires hardened pickaxe tuned against brittle crystalline structures
- Emits minor static discharges; insulated gear reduces stamina drain
- Each cycle yields 4 cobalt ore with a moderate harvest time
- Typically spawns near geothermal vents and obsidian shelves

## Crafting Applications
- Core ingredient for arcane capacitors and high-tier circuitry
- Used to temper shock-resistant armor plating
- Refined cobalt alloys empower advanced rune inlays

## Lore
Local legends speak of cobalt veins forming where lightning was captured beneath the earth, leaving crackling echoes that miners
still hear when they listen closely.
