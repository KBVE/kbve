# Salt Vein

Sparkling clusters of halite crystals embedded in pale limestone caverns. These veins often form along subterranean waterways
that have long since dried up.

## Mining Notes
- Can be harvested with basic pickaxe or chisel tools
- Each run yields 7 salt chunks with minimal effort
- Veins can regenerate slowly if exposed to groundwater seepage
- Crystalline glare may blind miners; tinted goggles recommended

## Crafting Applications
- Essential for food preservation and culinary trade routes
- Used in ritual circles to cleanse corrupted artifacts
- Ground into saltpeter precursors for alchemical reagents

## Lore
Salt miners swear that the veins sing softly when the tides are high above ground, guiding them toward untouched chambers filled
with prismatic crystals.
