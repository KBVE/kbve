# Coal Vein

Thick, soot-stained veins of coal that break apart into dense fuel chunks. These deposits form near ancient forest beds that were
compressed under volcanic pressure.

## Mining Notes
- Harvestable with standard pickaxe or reinforced shovel
- Produces 8 coal per cycle, making it a reliable fuel source
- Rapid extraction time but veins deplete if left unmaintained
- Emits coal dust clouds; respirators mitigate vision penalties

## Crafting Applications
- Primary fuel for smelters, forges, and steam-powered machinery
- Processed into coke for high-temperature metallurgical work
- Combined with reagents to craft smoke bombs and signal flares

## Lore
Old miners whisper that coal veins remember the forests they once were; burning offerings of sap can reveal hidden seams within
the darkest tunnels.
