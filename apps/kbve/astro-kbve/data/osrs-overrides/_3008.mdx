## Obtaining

Energy potions cannot be made through Herblore. Instead, visit the **Apothecary in Varrock** with:
- 2 Limpwurt roots
- 1 Chocolate dust

This is free-to-play content and requires no skills.

## Usage

Restores 10% run energy per dose. While weak compared to modern alternatives, useful for:
- F2P players
- Early-game ironmen
- Budget option for walking content

## Market Strategy

**F2P Demand:**
- Only energy restoration available in F2P
- Low volume market
- Consider making at Apothecary for profit

**Better Alternatives (P2P):**
- [Super energy(4)](/osrs/super-energy-4/) - 20% restore
- [Stamina potion(4)](/osrs/stamina-potion-4/) - 20% + reduced drain

**Buy Limit:** 2,000 per 4 hours
