## Obtaining

Raw dark crabs are caught in the **Wilderness Resource Area** (level 51-54 Wilderness):
- Requires 85 Fishing
- 130 Fishing XP per catch
- Requires dark fishing bait
- **Warning:** PKers frequent this area

## Cooking

| Level | XP | Stop Burning |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| 90 | 215 | 99 (with cooking gauntlets at lower levels) |

Dark crabs heal 22 HP when cooked, tied with manta rays for highest single-bite healing.

## Market Strategy

**Wilderness Risk/Reward:**
- High profit potential but dangerous location
- Raw crabs often supply comes from PvMers/skillers
- Bait cost affects margins

**Food Comparison:**
- Same healing as manta ray (22 HP)
- Often cheaper due to wilderness sourcing
- Popular for PvP due to 1-tick eating

**Buy Limit:** 6,000 per 4 hours
