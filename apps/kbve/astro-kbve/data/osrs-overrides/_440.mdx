## Smithing

Smelt to create bars:

| Product | Other Materials | Smithing Level | XP |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| Iron bar | None (50% success) | 15 | 12.5 |
| Iron bar | Ring of forging (100%) | 15 | 12.5 |
| Steel bar | 2 Coal | 30 | 17.5 |

## Market Flip Strategy

**Blast Furnace Iron Bars:**
- 100% success rate at Blast Furnace
- No ring of forging needed
- Calculate: `Iron bar price - Iron ore price = Profit`

**Steel Bar Production:**
- Iron ore + Coal → Steel bar
- At Blast Furnace: Only 1 coal needed
- Compare margins between iron and steel bars

**Tips:**
- Iron ore has very high supply from bots/players
- Ring of forging provides 140 charges at 100% success
- Blast Furnace is always more profitable
