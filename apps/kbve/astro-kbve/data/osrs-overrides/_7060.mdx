## Effects

| Effect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Healing | 22 Hitpoints |

## Usage

Tuna potato is one of the highest instant-healing foods:
- Tied with manta ray, dark crab, anglerfish, and bluefin at 22 HP
- Single-bite consumption
- Complex to make (many preparation steps)

## Market Flip Strategy

**Cooking Profit:**
- Complex recipe = potential profit margins
- Requires multiple intermediate items
- Calculate full material costs vs sell price

**Comparison to Alternatives:**
- Same healing as manta ray and dark crab
- Heavier weight (0.5 kg) than alternatives
- Most complex preparation of any 22 HP food

**Buy Limit:** 6,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Low trade volume due to complex creation
- Ironman accounts may make these for efficient food
- Consider component flipping instead of full recipe
