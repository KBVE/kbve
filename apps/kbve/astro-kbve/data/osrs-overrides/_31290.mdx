## Obtaining

The trimmed Sailing cape is automatically obtained when a player has achieved level 99 in at least two skills. Purchase the base cape from Brass Hand Harry at the Pandemonium for 99,000 coins.

**Requirements:** Level 99 Sailing + Level 99 in another skill

## Usage

The Sailing cape (t) is the trimmed skillcape awarded to players who have achieved level 99 in the Sailing skill and at least one other skill.

**Perk Benefits:**
- Rename boats without visiting an NPC
- Unlimited teleports to the Pandemonium
- Note: Cargo will be lost when using the boat teleport feature

**Trimmed Bonus:**
- +4 Prayer bonus (compared to untrimmed version)

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable** - Cannot be bought or sold on the Grand Exchange.

**Tips:**
- Required 99 Sailing to obtain
- Requires 99 in a second skill to unlock trimmed version
- Additional +4 Prayer bonus makes this version superior for prayer-heavy activities
