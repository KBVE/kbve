**Requirements:** 82 Magic, 50 Hitpoints

## Special Attack

**Invocate** (55% energy):
- Standard magic attack
- Restores prayer equal to 50% of damage dealt
- Prayer restoration capped at 120 points
- Works in both PvM and PvP

**Best prayer sustain weapon in the game.**

## Usage

BiS for prayer-sustain content:
- Inferno (wave 62-66 and Zuk)
- Extended bossing trips
- Solo content without altars
- Any long-duration magic combat

## Inferno Strategy

The Eldritch nightmare staff is particularly valuable in the Inferno, where prayer points are limited. Using the special attack on sets can provide significant prayer restoration, reducing reliance on Super restores.

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable** - Components total ~212M gp

**Tips:**
- Most expensive Nightmare orb
- Essential for Inferno
- Can dismantle if needed
- High-end PvM investment
