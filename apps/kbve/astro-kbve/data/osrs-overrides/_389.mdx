## Obtaining

Raw manta ray is obtained exclusively from the **Fishing Trawler** minigame:
- Requires 81 Fishing
- 46 Fishing XP per catch
- Part of the trawler loot pool

## Cooking

| Level | XP | Stop Burning |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| 91 | 216.2 | 99 (never with gauntlets) |

Manta rays heal 22 HP when cooked, making them one of the highest healing foods.

## Market Strategy

**Trawler Profit:**
- Raw mantas are a valuable Trawler reward
- Sell raw for profit or cook for XP
- Calculate: `Manta ray - Raw manta ray = Cooking profit`

**Food Comparison:**
- Manta ray (22 HP) vs Shark (20 HP)
- Higher healing but harder to obtain
- Often more expensive than sharks

**Buy Limit:** 6,000 per 4 hours
