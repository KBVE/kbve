## Cooking

Cook Raw shark on a fire or range to get Shark.

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Cooking Level** | 80 |
| **Burn stop level** | 94 (89 with Cooking gauntlets + Hosidius range) |
| **XP gained** | 210 |

## Market Flip Strategy

**Cook for Profit:**
- Buy Raw shark → Cook → Sell Shark
- Calculate: `Shark price - Raw shark price = Cooking profit`
- Account for burn rate at your level

**Buy Limit:** 15,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Use Hosidius kitchen (5% reduced burn rate)
- Cooking gauntlets significantly reduce burns
- High volume item, consistent demand

**Burn Rate Consideration:**
- At level 80: ~20% burn rate
- At level 89 (gauntlets + Hosidius): 0% burn rate
- Factor burnt sharks into profit calculation
