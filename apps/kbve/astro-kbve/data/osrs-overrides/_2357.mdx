| Regular furnace | 40 | 22.5 |
| Blast Furnace | 40 | 22.5 |
| Goldsmith gauntlets | 40 | 56.2 |

| Gold necklace | 6 | 20 | Enchantable |
| Gold bracelet | 7 | 25 | Enchantable |

## Market Flip Strategy

**Goldsmith Gauntlets Method:**
- Buy Gold ore → Smelt at Blast Furnace with Goldsmith gauntlets
- Best Smithing XP in game
- Calculate: `Gold bar price - Gold ore price = Smelting profit`

**Jewelry Making:**
1. Gold bar + Mould → Jewelry
2. String → Unstrung amulet
3. Enchant → Valuable amulet

**Tips:**
- Blast Furnace is the meta for gold bars
- Goldsmith gauntlets from Family Crest quest
- High volume item for both Smithing and Crafting training
