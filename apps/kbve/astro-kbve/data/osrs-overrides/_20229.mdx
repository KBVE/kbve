## About

The honourable blessing is an Armadyl-aligned item worn in the ammunition slot, providing +1 prayer bonus. It is the Armadyl equivalent of other god blessings.

Blessings are valuable because they provide prayer bonus in the ammunition slot, which normally has no prayer-boosting options. This makes them useful for any build that wants to maximize prayer bonus without sacrificing ranging capability.

## Passive Effects

**God Wars Protection:**
- Counts as an Armadyl item in the God Wars Dungeon
- Armadyl followers will not be aggressive when worn

## Market Strategy

**Investment Notes:**
- Prices vary between different god blessings
- Armadyl version useful for Kree'arra
- Popular for ranging setups at Armadyl

**Trading Tips:**
- Compare prices between all six blessings
- Consider God Wars Dungeon utility when pricing
- Popular with players wanting prayer bonus in ammo slot
