## Extra Ammunition Slot

- Equip two types of ammunition simultaneously
- Switch between arrow/bolt types without opening inventory
- Perfect for bosses requiring different ammo types

**Example Uses:**

- Dragon arrows and Amethyst arrows for different situations
- Broad bolts for Slayer and Ruby bolts for bosses

**Charging Material:** Sunfire splinters
**Maximum Charges:** 20,000
**Charged Bonus:** +1 Ranged Strength, +10 Ranged accuracy

**Charge Cost:**
- 20,000 Sunfire splinters x ~145 GP = ~2.9M GP for full charge

## Obtaining

Dizana's quiver is obtained exclusively from:

**Source:** Fortis Colosseum
**Requirement:** Defeat Sol Heredit (Wave 12 boss)
**Tradeable:** No - must be earned personally

This makes it one of the most prestigious ranged items in the game, requiring mastery of the Colosseum.

## Comparison to Alternatives

| Cape | Ranged Attack | Ranged Strength | Special |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Dizana's quiver (charged) | +28 | +4 | Extra ammo slot |
| Dizana's quiver (uncharged) | +18 | +3 | Extra ammo slot |
| Ava's assembler | +8 | +2 | Ammo retrieval |
| Masori assembler | +8 | +2 | Ammo retrieval |

**Best for:** High-level ranged combat where stats outweigh ammo retrieval.

## Usage

Best scenarios for Dizana's quiver:

- **Theatre of Blood:** Switch between bolt types for different rooms
- **Chambers of Xeric:** Multiple bosses requiring different ammo
- **General bossing:** Maximum ranged DPS setups
- **Inferno:** BiS ranged cape when charged
- **PvP:** Quick ammo switches without inventory management

**Note:** You lose Ava's ammo retrieval effect. Factor in increased ammo costs.

**Tips:**
- Requires Colosseum completion - cannot be bought
