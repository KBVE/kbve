## Appearance

The Menaphite ornament kit gives the ward a golden Menaphite-themed appearance with Egyptian-style decorations, matching the aesthetic of the Tombs of Amascut.

## How to Obtain

The Menaphite ornament kit is only obtained from Tombs of Amascut at 425+ invocation with zero deaths for all party members.

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable** - Ward (f) ~550M gp + untradeable ornament

**Tips:**
- Status symbol for mages
- Requires flawless Expert ToA
- Same functionality as fortified ward
- Easier than Cursed phalanx (425 vs 500)
