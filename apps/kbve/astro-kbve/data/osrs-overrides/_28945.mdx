## Equipment Info

Echo boots are the best-in-slot melee boots for prayer-focused builds, created by combining Guardian boots with an Echo crystal from the Fortis Colosseum. These untradeable boots offer exceptional defensive stats, a strength bonus, and a unique recoil effect.

**Slot:** Feet
**Requirements:** 75 Defence
**Tradeable:** No (created by combining tradeable components)

## Stats

### Defensive Bonuses
| Defence Type | Bonus |
|--------------|-------|
| Stab | +32 |
| Slash | +32 |
| Crush | +32 |
| Magic | -3 |
| Ranged | +24 |

### Other Bonuses
| Stat | Bonus |
|------|-------|
| Magic Attack | -3 |
| Ranged Attack | -1 |
| Melee Strength | +3 |
| Prayer | +4 |

## Recoil Effect

Echo boots feature a unique passive effect:

**Recoil Aura:**
- Deals 1 damage to any attacker within a 3x3 area
- Works against multiple attackers simultaneously
- **Total Charges:** 60,000

**Note:** The recoil effect will eventually deplete all charges. Monitor remaining charges to avoid losing the effect unexpectedly.

## Creation

Echo boots are created by combining:

| Material | Quantity | Tradeable |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Guardian boots | 1 | Yes |
| Echo crystal | 1 | Yes |

**Process:** Use the Echo crystal on Guardian boots to create Echo boots.

**Warning:** This is a permanent, irreversible upgrade. Echo boots cannot be converted back to Guardian boots.

## Comparison to Alternatives

| Boots | Strength | Prayer | Defence |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| Echo boots | +3 | +4 | +32/32/32 |
| Guardian boots | +3 | +0 | +32/32/32 |
| Primordial boots | +5 | +0 | +22/22/22 |

**Best for:** Prayer-focused melee builds where the +4 prayer outweighs +2 strength from Primordials.

## Usage

Ideal scenarios for Echo boots:

- **Inferno:** Prayer bonus is invaluable
- **Extended boss trips:** Reduces prayer potion usage
- **GWD:** Combined with Sunfire Fanatic for maximum prayer
- **Fight Caves:** Efficient Jad kills
- **Multi-combat areas:** Recoil damages multiple attackers

## Market Strategy

**Tradeable:** No (untradeable item)

**Creation Cost:**
- Guardian boots: ~35M GP
- Echo crystal: ~1.8M GP
- **Total:** ~36.8M GP

**Tips:**
- Ensure you want this upgrade before committing
- Cannot be sold or traded once created
- Best value for accounts focusing on prayer builds
- Calculate if prayer bonus worth Primordial alternative
- Recoil effect provides bonus utility in multi-combat
