## Obtaining

Celastrus bark is harvested from fully grown celastrus trees:
- Requires 85 Farming to plant
- Located in the Farming Guild
- Each harvest yields 3+ bark
- Can use magic secateurs for more yield

## Fletching

| Input | Output | Fletching Level | XP |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-----|
| 1 Celastrus bark | 1 Battlestaff | 40 | 6 |

This is the only way to fletch battlestaves from raw materials.

## Market Strategy

**Farming Guild Profit:**
- Celastrus trees are profitable to grow
- Multiple bark per harvest
- Consistent supply from farming runs

**Battlestaff Chain:**
1. Grow celastrus tree (85 Farming)
2. Harvest bark
3. Fletch into battlestaff
4. Attach orb for elemental staff
5. Alch or sell

**Comparison to Buying Staffs:**
- Compare bark + fletching vs buying battlestaves from Zaff
- Zaff's stock is limited daily

**Buy Limit:** 11,000 per 4 hours
