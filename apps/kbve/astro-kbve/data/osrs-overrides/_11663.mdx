## Set Effect

**Void Mage Set Bonus:**
- +45% magic accuracy when worn with full Void Knight equipment
- Requires: Void knight top, robe, gloves, and this helm

**Note:** Does not provide magic damage boost, only accuracy.

## Usage

**Best For:**
- Magic accuracy-focused setups
- Switching between combat styles in raids
- Budget alternative when Ancestral not available
- Zulrah (quick gear switches)

**Comparison:**
- Less accuracy/defence than Ahrim's robes individually
- Set bonus can surpass Ahrim's in specific scenarios

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable** - Must earn through Pest Control.

**Tips:**
- 200 points = ~2-3 hours of Pest Control
- Veteran boat fastest points/hour
- Consider elite upgrade from Western Provinces diary
