## About

The peaceful blessing is a Guthix-aligned item worn in the ammunition slot, providing +1 prayer bonus. It is the Guthix equivalent of other god blessings.

Blessings are valuable because they provide prayer bonus in the ammunition slot, which normally has no prayer-boosting options. This makes them useful for any build that wants to maximize prayer bonus without sacrificing ranging capability.

## Passive Effects

**Note:** Guthix items do not provide protection in the God Wars Dungeon as Guthix has no faction there. However, the blessing still provides the +1 prayer bonus.

## Market Strategy

**Investment Notes:**
- Prices vary between different god blessings
- Guthix version often cheapest due to no GWD utility
- Good budget option for prayer bonus in ammo slot

**Trading Tips:**
- Compare prices between all six blessings
- Often cheapest blessing option
- Popular with players wanting affordable prayer bonus
