## Equipment Info

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Slot | Weapon (Main-hand) |
| Type | Sword |
| Tradeable | No (untradeable due to ornament) |
| Weight | 1.814 kg |
| Attack Speed | 4 tick (2.4s) |

## Creation

Combine [Osmumten's fang](/osrs/osmumtens-fang/) + [Cursed phalanx](/osrs/cursed-phalanx/).

**Process is reversible** - can be dismantled to recover both items.

**Note:** This is a purely cosmetic upgrade. Stats are identical to the regular Osmumten's fang.

## Stats

| Offense | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Stab | +105 |
| Slash | +75 |
| Strength | +103 |

**Requirements:** 82 Attack

## Passive Effect

**Double Accuracy Roll:**
- Rolls accuracy twice on stab attacks
- Hit lands if either roll succeeds

**Damage Normalization:**
- Hits 15-85% of max hit
- Same average damage, less variance

## Special Attack

**Eviscerate** (25% energy):
- +50% accuracy
- Uses true max hit (ignores normalization)
- ~17.65% damage increase

## Appearance

The Cursed phalanx gives the fang a distinctive dark, corrupted appearance with purple/black coloring. This is considered one of the most prestigious cosmetics in the game due to the difficulty of obtaining the ornament kit.

## How to Obtain

The Cursed phalanx is only obtained from Tombs of Amascut at 500+ invocation with zero deaths for all party members - one of the hardest achievements in the game.

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable** - Fang ~23M gp + untradeable ornament

**Tips:**
- Status symbol in-game
- Requires flawless Expert ToA
- Same functionality as regular fang
- Can revert if needed
