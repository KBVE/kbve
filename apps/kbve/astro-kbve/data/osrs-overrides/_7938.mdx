Chip dark essence blocks with a chisel:
- Use chisel on dark essence block
- Yields 4 fragments per block
- No level requirement to chip

## Runecrafting

| Rune | Level | XP per Fragment | Multiple Runes |
|------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Blood rune | 77 | 23.8 | At 77, 89 (+1 at 100 RC via cape) |
| Soul rune | 90 | 29.7 | At 90 only |

## Blood Rune Crafting Process

1. Mine dense essence blocks (38 Mining/Crafting)
2. Transform at Dark Altar (2.5 XP)
3. Chip into 4 fragments
4. Craft at Blood Altar (23.8 XP each)

## Market Strategy

**AFK Runecrafting:**
- Very AFK method for RC training
- Good profit from blood/soul runes
- Raiments of the Eye boost rune output

**Profit Calculation:**
- Blood runes: ~4 per trip × price
- Soul runes: ~4 per trip × price
- Both methods profitable and chill

**Untradeable:** Cannot be traded
