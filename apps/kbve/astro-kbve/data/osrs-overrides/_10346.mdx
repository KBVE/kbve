## About

The 3rd age platelegs are part of the 3rd age melee set, one of the rarest and most prestigious armour sets in Old School RuneScape. They require 65 Defence to wear and provide stats comparable to rune platelegs but with superior aesthetics.

3rd age equipment is highly sought after due to its extreme rarity and status symbol value. It can only be obtained from Treasure Trails, specifically from master clue scroll caskets at an exceptionally low drop rate.

- Extremely valuable due to rarity
