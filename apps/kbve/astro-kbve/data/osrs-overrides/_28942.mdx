## Item Info

The Echo crystal is a rare material dropped from the Fortis Colosseum used to upgrade Guardian boots into the powerful Echo boots. This shimmering crystal contains the echoes of battles fought in the arena.

**Type:** Material
**Stackable:** No
**Tradeable:** Yes
**Weight:** 0.5 kg

## Obtaining

Echo crystals are obtained exclusively from the Fortis Colosseum:

- **Drop Location:** Waves 4-12
- **Drop Rate:** Varies based on wave reached
- Higher waves have better drop rates
- Guaranteed at certain completion milestones

**Note:** You must survive to receive the crystal as a reward. Dying will forfeit potential drops.

## Usage

Echo crystals have a single purpose:

### Creating Echo Boots
Combine with Guardian boots to create Echo boots:

**Materials Required:**
- 1x Guardian boots (Item ID: 21733)
- 1x Echo crystal (Item ID: 28942)

**Result:** Echo boots (Item ID: 28945) - Untradeable

**Important:** This is a one-way upgrade. Echo boots cannot be reverted to Guardian boots.

## Echo Boots Benefits

The upgrade provides:
- **+4 Prayer bonus** (Guardian boots have 0)
- **Recoil effect:** Deals 1 damage to attackers in 3x3 area
- **60,000 charges** on the recoil effect
- Best-in-slot melee boots for prayer builds

## Market Strategy

**Buy Limit:** 8 per 4 hours
**Estimated Price:** ~1.8M GP

**Tips:**
- Price largely determined by Guardian boots price
- Calculate total upgrade cost: Echo crystal + Guardian boots
- Consider if untradeable result is worth investment
- High demand from players seeking BiS melee boots
- Price fluctuates with Colosseum activity levels
- More valuable earlier in the week (fresh restocks)
