- Successful magic attacks have 25% chance to lower enemy Strength by 5 levels
- Useful for reducing opponent's damage output

**With Amulet of the Damned:**
- Successful magic attacks have 25% chance to deal 30% extra damage

## Usage

- Magic training (budget option)
- Barrows running (ironic but common)
- Mid-level magic PvM
- Zulrah (budget setup)

**Comparison:**
- Less magic bonus than Ancestral
- Better than Mystic robes
- Good defensive stats for magic armor

- Repair cost: ~70k for full set at Bob

## Market Strategy

**Buy Limit:** 10 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Budget magic armor option
- Often bought as full set
- Consider Ancestral for endgame
