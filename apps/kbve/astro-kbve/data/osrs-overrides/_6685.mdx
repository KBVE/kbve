## Effects

Per dose:
- **Heals:** 15% + 2 of max HP
- **Boosts Defence:** 20% + 2 of base level
- **Lowers:** Attack, Strength, Magic, Ranged by 10% + 2

## Usage

Essential for high-level PvM:
- Raids (CoX, ToB, ToA)
- Inferno attempts
- Boss fights (GWD, Nex, etc.)
- PvP (often combo'd with Super restore)

## Market Flip Strategy

**Potion Making:**
- Toadflax + Vial of water → Unfinished potion
- Add Crushed nest → Saradomin brew
- Calculate: `Brew price - Toadflax - Crushed nest - Vial = Profit`

**Buy Limit:** 2,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- High demand from raiders
- Crushed nest price drives margins
- Often paired with Super restores (3:1 ratio)
