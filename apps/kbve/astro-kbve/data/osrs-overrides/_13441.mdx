## Overheal Effect

Anglerfish can **overheal** above max HP (outside PvP):

| Hitpoints Level | Heal Amount | Max HP |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| 75 | 19 | 94 |
| 85 | 20 | 105 |
| 93+ | 22 | 115+ |
| 99 | 22 | 121 |

## Market Flip Strategy

**Cooking Profit:**
- Buy Raw anglerfish → Cook → Sell
- 84+ Cooking required, burns until 99 without gauntlets

**Buy Limit:** 10,000 per 4 hours

**Demand Drivers:**
- Pre-fight overheal for bosses
- Inferno attempts
- Raids preparation
- High-level Slayer

**Tips:**
- Premium price over sharks
- Essential for difficult PvM
- Caught at Port Piscarilius (Kourend)
