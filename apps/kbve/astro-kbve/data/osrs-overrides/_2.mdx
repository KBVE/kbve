## Smithing

Smith Steel bars with an Ammo mould to create cannonballs.

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Smithing Level | 35 |
| Bars per craft | 1 |
| Cannonballs produced | 4 |
| XP per bar | 25.6 |

**Double Ammo Mould:**
- Obtained from Giants' Foundry
- Produces 8 cannonballs from 2 bars at same speed
- Effectively doubles production rate

## Market Flip Strategy

**Steel Bar Processing:**
- Buy Steel bar → Smith → Sell cannonballs
- 1 bar = 4 cannonballs
- Calculate: `(Cannonball price × 4) - Steel bar price = Profit`

**Profit Estimate:**
- ~306 GP profit per steel bar (after GE tax)
- ~179,400 GP/hour at optimal speed
- Very AFK method - popular for alts

**Buy Limit:** 11,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Extremely AFK - good for mobile/alts
- High daily volume (~206M traded)
- Consistent demand from slayer/PvM

## Upgrade Path

Cannonballs can be upgraded with granite dust:

| Upgrade | Smithing Level | Result |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| + Granite dust | 50 | Granite cannonball |
