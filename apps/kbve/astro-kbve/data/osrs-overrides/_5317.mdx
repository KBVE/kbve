| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Farming Level | 83 |
| Growth Time | 64 hours |
| Planting XP | 199.5 |
| Check-health XP | 19,301.8 |

2. Tree Gnome Stronghold

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable Growth:**
- Spirit trees cannot be removed once grown
- Seeds are relatively rare
- Ironmen must hunt specific sources

**Collection Log:**
- Required for some collection log completions
- Drop rate means long-term grind

**Buy Limit:** 200 per 4 hours
