## Equipment Info

The Tonalztics of ralos (charged) is the powered-up version of this formidable ranged weapon from the Fortis Colosseum. When charged with Sunfire splinters, this weapon gains the powerful ability to hit twice with each attack.

**Weapon Type:** Thrown
**Attack Speed:** 7 (same as longbow)
**Special Effect:** Hits twice per attack when charged

## Stats

| Stat | Bonus |
|------|-------|
| Ranged Attack | +115 |
| Ranged Strength | +55 |
| Prayer | +2 |

## Special Attack

**Division** (50% special attack energy)

The special attack reduces the target's Defence by 10% of their Magic level with each hit. Since the charged version hits twice, this can reduce Defence by up to 20% of the target's Magic level per special attack.

## Double Hit Mechanic

The charged Tonalztics of ralos has a unique mechanic:

- **Each attack hits twice** - effectively doubling your damage output
- Uses one charge per attack (not per hit)
- Both hits can trigger the special attack effect
- Significantly increases DPS compared to uncharged version

## Charging

- **Maximum Charges:** 20,000
- **Material Required:** Sunfire splinters (Item ID: 28924)
- **Charges Per Splinter:** 1

To charge, use Sunfire splinters on the uncharged Tonalztics of ralos.

## Usage

Best uses for the charged Tonalztics:

- **Bossing:** Excellent DPS with double hits
- **Fortis Colosseum:** Top-tier for speed runs
- **PvP:** Devastating burst damage potential
- **Slayer:** Efficient for high-HP ranged tasks
- **Sol Heredit:** Effective against the final Colosseum boss

**Pro Tip:** The double hit makes this one of the highest DPS ranged weapons in the game when factoring in both hits.

## Market Strategy

**Buy Limit:** 8 per 4 hours
**Estimated Price:** ~47M GP (includes splinter value)

- Charged version trades at premium over uncharged

- Monitor Sunfire splinter prices for true value
- Popular for high-level PvM content
