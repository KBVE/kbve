## Creation

Mix Ranarr potion (unf) + White berries.

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Herblore Level | 30 |
| XP gained | 75 |

## Effect

Temporarily boosts Defence by 3 + 10% of level:

| Defence Level | Boost |
|---------------|-------|
| 1-9 | +3 |
| 10-19 | +4 |
| 50-59 | +8 |
| 90-99 | +12 |

Boost decays 1 point per minute.

## Usage

Budget Defence boost for:
- Mid-game bossing
- Slayer tasks
- Training with protection

## Upgrades

| Potion | Boost | Level |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Defence potion(4) | 3 + 10% | 30 |
| Super defence(4) | 5 + 15% | 66 |
| Super combat(4) | Combined | 90 |

## Market Strategy

**Potion Making:**
- Uses Ranarr weed - same as Prayer potions
- Calculate: `Defence potion - Ranarr - White berries = Profit`
- Buy limit: 2,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Competes with Prayer potions for Ranarr
- White berries are relatively cheap
- Most players prefer Super defence
