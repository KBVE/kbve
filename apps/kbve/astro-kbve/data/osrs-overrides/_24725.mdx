## Usage

The Hallowed symbol is a special tool used in the Hallowed Sepulchre minigame. When equipped in the neck slot, it halves the number of fire sacrifices required at brazier obstacles.

### Mechanics

- Must be equipped in neck slot to function
- Reduces required fire sacrifices by 50%
- Saves time at brazier obstacles
- Works passively while equipped

## About

Brazier obstacles in the Hallowed Sepulchre require players to sacrifice fire items (logs, ashes, etc.) to proceed. The Hallowed symbol reduces this requirement, speeding up runs significantly.

This is one of four specialized tools for the Hallowed Sepulchre, each targeting a specific obstacle type.
