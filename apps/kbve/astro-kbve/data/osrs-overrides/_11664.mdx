## Set Effect

**Void Ranger Set Bonus (Regular):**
- +10% ranged damage
- +10% ranged accuracy

**Void Ranger Set Bonus (Elite):**
- +12.5% ranged damage
- +10% ranged accuracy

Requires: Void knight top, robe, gloves, and this helm.

## Usage

**Best For:**
- Chinning/bursting training at MM2 caves
- Theatre of Blood (Nylocas room)
- Vorkath (with DHCB)
- General ranged DPS when damage boost outweighs armour stats

**Comparison:**
- Less defensive stats than Armadyl/Masori
- Damage boost makes it BiS in certain scenarios
- Elite void essential for endgame content

## Market Strategy

**Untradeable** - Must earn through Pest Control.

**Tips:**
- 200 points = ~2-3 hours of Pest Control
- Elite upgrade requires Western Provinces hard diary
- Prioritize this helm if focusing on ranged
