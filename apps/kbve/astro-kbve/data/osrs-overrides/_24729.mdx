## About

Dark dye can only be obtained from the Hallowed Sepulchre reward shop. The Hallowed graceful recolor is one of the most prestigious graceful variants, as it requires significant time investment in the challenging Sepulchre minigame.

### Reverting

The recolor can be reverted by using a dark dye remover on the Hallowed graceful piece. The dye is lost in the process.
