## Market Flip Strategy

**Fletching Profit:**
- Calculate: `(Rune arrow × 15) - (Headless arrow × 15) - (Rune arrowtips × 15) = Profit`
- 75 Fletching required
- Check arrowtip vs arrow margins

**Component Chain:**
- Arrow shaft + Feather = Headless arrow
- Runite bar → Rune arrowtips

**Buy Limit:** 11,000 per 4 hours

- Crystal bow alternative ammo
- PKing (cheaper than dragon)
- General PvM
