## Creation

Dark essence blocks are created at the **Dark Altar** in Arceuus:

| Input | Output | XP |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Dense essence block | Dark essence block | 2.5 Runecraft |

Creating dark essence drains 1 prayer point per block.

## Runecrafting

Dark essence blocks are used to craft blood and soul runes:

| Rune | Level | XP per Fragment |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Blood rune | 77 | 23.8 |
| Soul rune | 90 | 29.7 |

Each dark essence block is chipped into fragments for crafting.

## Market Strategy

**Arceuus Runecrafting:**
- Untradeable, must be made yourself
- Part of blood/soul rune crafting cycle
- AFK method for Runecraft training

**Blood Rune Profit:**
- Calculate: `Blood rune price × runes crafted - Dense essence cost`
- Very profitable at higher levels
- AFK and consistent income

**Buy Limit:** Untradeable
