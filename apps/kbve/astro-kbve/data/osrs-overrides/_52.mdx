## Creation

Use a Knife on any logs to create Arrow shafts.

| Log Type | Shafts per Log | Fletching Level |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Logs | 15 | 1 |
| Oak logs | 30 | 15 |
| Willow logs | 45 | 30 |
| Maple logs | 60 | 45 |
| Yew logs | 75 | 60 |
| Magic logs | 90 | 75 |

## Usage

Add feathers and arrowtips to create arrows:

1. Arrow shaft + Feather = Headless arrow
2. Headless arrow + Arrowtips = Finished arrows

## Market Flip Strategy

**Bulk Processing:**
- High volume, low margin item
- Compare: `Log price` vs `Arrow shaft price × shafts per log`
- Best margins often with regular Logs

**Headless Arrow Flipping:**
- Buy Arrow shafts + Feathers
- Fletch into Headless arrows
- Sell to fletchers making finished arrows
