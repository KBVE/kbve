## Creation

Add a pineapple ring to a plain pizza (no cooking required).

## Effects

| Effect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total healing | 22 Hitpoints |
| Healing per bite | 11 Hitpoints |
| Bites | 2 |

## Usage

Pineapple pizza is useful for:
- Budget high-healing food option
- Training activities where multiple bites are acceptable
- Ironman food source
- Situations where inventory space is less critical

## Market Flip Strategy

**Pizza Making:**
- Plain pizza + Pineapple ring = Pineapple pizza
- Calculate: `Pineapple pizza - Plain pizza - Pineapple ring`
- Members-only item

**Comparison:**
- Same total healing as manta ray, dark crab, tuna potato
- Requires 2 bites (slower in combat)
- Generally cheaper than single-bite alternatives

**Buy Limit:** 6,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Two bites makes it less ideal for high-intensity PvM
- Good for activities with downtime between combat
- Popular for training slayer on easier tasks
