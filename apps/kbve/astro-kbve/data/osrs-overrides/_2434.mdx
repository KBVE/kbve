## Usage

Prayer potions are essential for:
- All boss fights
- Slayer tasks with protection prayers
- Raids (CoX, ToB, ToA)
- PvP combat
- Wilderness activities

## Market Flip Strategy

**Potion Making Profit:**
- Calculate: `Prayer potion(4) - Ranarr weed - Snape grass - Vial of water`
- High volume, consistent demand
- Essential consumable = stable prices

**Dose Manipulation:**
- Buy 4-dose, decant to 3-dose (or vice versa)
- Check price differences between dose sizes
- Use decanting NPC in GE

**Buy Limit:** 2,000 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- One of the highest volume potions traded
- Price follows Ranarr weed price closely
