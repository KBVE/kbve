## Obtaining

The Eclipse atlatl is obtained from the Lunar Chest in Neypotzli with a 1/224 drop rate.

**Requirements:** 75 Ranged, 50 Attack, 50 Strength to equip

## Combat Mechanics

The Eclipse atlatl is unique among ranged weapons:
- Uses the player's **melee strength bonus** for damage calculation
- Ranged bonus still determines accuracy
- Attack speed: 4 ticks (3 ticks on rapid)

**Set Effect:** When wearing full eclipse moon armour, successful hits have a 20% chance to inflict burn damage on targets.

## Special Attack

**Eclipse** (50% energy):
- Requires full eclipse moon armour set
- Magic-based attack at melee distance
- 50% accuracy bonus
- Consumes remaining burn damage on target to boost damage output

## Usage

Best-in-slot for hybrid setups where melee strength gear is worn:
- Neypotzli content
- Unique DPS setups combining melee gear with ranged attacks
- Specialized boss strategies

## Market Strategy

**Buy Limit:** 8 per 4 hours

**Tips:**
- Value tied to full set synergy
- Requires atlatl darts as ammunition
- Unique hybrid mechanics make it situational but powerful
