## Farming

Plant in a herb patch to grow Grimy marrentill.

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Farming Level | 14 |
| Growth time | 80 minutes |
| XP (plant) | 13.5 |
| XP (harvest) | 15 per herb |

## Market Strategy

**Herb Farming:**
- Low-tier herb seed
- Used for antipoison potions
- Low value, good for early training

**Yield Boosters:**
- Ultracompost (essential)
- Magic secateurs (10% more yield)
- Farming cape (5% more yield)

**Tips:**
- 9 herb patches available
- ~10 minute runs, 80 minute regrowth
- Consider upgrading to higher tier seeds for profit
