## About

Bridge obstacles in the Hallowed Sepulchre require planks and nails to repair. Normally, nails have a chance to break based on their type. The Hallowed hammer eliminates this RNG, ensuring no wasted nails.

This is one of four specialized tools for the Hallowed Sepulchre, each targeting a specific obstacle type.
