### Andor

-   05:40PM

    I am dying to see the next three episodes drop for Andor!
    Episode 7 to 9, another movie drop, lets go.

### Pipe JSON & Flex

-   06:06PM

    We handle both the flexbuffers and the json together, I am thinking that it would be wise to first build them both out via the jedi crate.
    Quickly refactor the pipe_redis to use `Logic_$Command_$Payload` as a common structure and then include functions for both.
    I was thinking of unifying the functions but that might be an issue because of the zero-copy and the different data structures, that it might be wise to just split them.
    We can re-use the binary functions in the future but for now this should be fast enough for what we want to do.

### Pipe WatchMaster

-   02:25AM

    I was up all night trying to figure out the best way to handle the rewrite of the WatchMaster and maybe even the TempleState.
    The TempleState already keeps track of the Redis Pool and the active connections via the WatchMaster.
    Furthermore, the TempleState is our AppState for Axum too but we already wrapped it inside of an Arc entity.
    
### India Strikes

-   05:48PM

    Keeping a close watch on the missile strikes, hopefully nothing goes too bad between both nations.
    This feels like another gaza situation, where India might just use the terror attack as an excuse to launch another massive war.
    The bigger issue is that it will end up creating more terrorists in the long term, its a classic situation of a butterfly effect.

**JukeBox**

The jukebox client side code has been updated but a couple more patches that I need to build out.

**Resend**

The Email recovery still needs to be fixed, I am going to add the API directly into the Rust codebase!
However there might be a couple aspects of the code's flow that I need to look over, do we want to have a captcha before the email recovery?
I understand that it might be a bit weak on the UIUX but the security issues that can arise by not having some level of protection on the path might be a pain in the future.

Let me add a couple schemas to prepare for the Resend API Integration:

```rust

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct RecoverUserSchema {
	pub email: String,
	pub captcha: String,
}

```

**India**

- 9:00am - Going to miss this amazing breakfast place, for under $3 or 200 Rupees, I get nearly a full course meal. It keeps me fed throughout the day but damn them eggs do produce some deadly methane gas xD

- 9:30am - Restoring the `asset.astro` and the `media.astro` paths to avoid some broken links when navigating through the menu on the main website.

- 10:30am - Read this great article from [SemiAnalysis No Moat](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) that goes over the lack of a moat from Google / OpenAI within the eco-system of Ai/mL, yet this can have some issues further down the line, including investment and capital markets, whom bet on companies being able to `secure` a moat. I believe that a hybrid source movement will remain the best course of action as of right now.

- 11:00am - Currently looking up the works of `Ursula K. Le Guin` and her universe of `Hainish Cycle` because she coined the term `Ansible`. The first piece of her work that I am going to read while taking this rickshaw is `Winter's King`. 

- 3:00pm - Currently on my last interview for a new job that I might start in June! I am excited but I might also decline because the amount of pay is not worth the amount of work that they might demand. We shall see, I usually enjoy working for startups but seeing how they conduct their interviews and testing has been very off-putting. I might also not get the job because I did decline to sign any NDAs until I felt more confident with the company.

- 9:00pm - Going to start to integrate Rive into the Flutter application! I have had great experience with Lottie but I been finding that they have a bit too limited animations for my taste and I do not feel like integrating React into Flutter at this time. If everything works out as planned, then I will remove Lottie from the `kbve.com` source and replace it with Rive as well.
