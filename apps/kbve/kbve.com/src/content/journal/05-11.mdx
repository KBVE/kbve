## 2025

### Unity MM Items

-   01:48AM

    Taking a quick break from the rust flow and going to focus on the unity dev side!
    Looking through the inventory engine code and this seems like it will be easier than expected.
    We got the first "DefensiveBlock" almost done, added a health bar and now just need to turn it into an item.
    

### KBVE Deployment

-   05:59PM

    I need to finish patching up the KBVE.com deployment, its been a while since we had an update.
    The issue is in the `utils-astro-deployment.yml` , which I am going to patch up tonight and then use that astro deployment to finish up the items.
    Bascially, I want to keep all the item configurations on the KBVE Astro docs and use astro to build the json data.
    After the json data gets built and pushed out, I will have the unity editor pull that data and build the items that we will be using in RareIcon.
    This means that future developers and players have a single source of truth for all the items that we will be using the game.
    Okay, I think the astro build is ready to be pushed up and we can do a quick test of it.

-   06:22PM

    Looks like the astro build is a bit broken, damn the svelte 4 to svelte 5 is going to be a pain to fix.
    Let me work through each of the files that are being referenced and maybe I can knock it out within the next couple hours.
    Before I begin, let me update the astro build and also save some of the CI changes.
    The upgrade will be from Astro v5.7.2 to v5.7.12, so we should not have any major breaking changes, hopefully.
    Testing the sync first and it looks like that part of the code is working.

-   07:55PM

    Okay! Looks like we got the build and general issues resolved for astro kbve.
    Let me go ahead and now finish up the build pipeline.
    Now the issue is over the cache control with KBVE.com, hmm.


## 2024

**Music**

I believe the best way to start a Saturday morning is jamming to music and maybe even making a couple beats.
With that being said, the jukebox is overdue for some minor graphical updates and a decent music dump should be added.

The genre of focus will be DnB? or should I go out of the electro realm and maybe do some Rock/Metal?
Oh options, thoughts and ideas! Let me S-S-S and maybe as the water flows through my hair, I will come up with a good game plan for the day!

To fix the buttons, we just had to pass the `border` class name and to add a bit of fun, I will throw in a quick `hover:scale-110`.

Okay! Cleaned up a bit more of the `/music/` MDX file and added more information, hopefully making it a better to understand.

Going through each of the songs from the DnB playlist, I think it might be time to add a couple other genres to the player!

`Electro Swing` and `Indie` are the next two that I want to add and expand upon.


**Rust**

I will have to go back and refactor some of the code, removing the match and using a ?-mark operator instead.
This was long overdue, but I think I have enough time to refactor it all without breaking anything.

**League**

Time to play a quick league match, it will be weird once the split hits and all the items get changed up again.
But 2nd tier upgraded boots!?! I am super excited to see what this will bring to the gameplay.
The game is turning into trash.

**DnB**

Time to add some drum and bass!
There is about 700 songs that I would like to parse through and add, but the amount of time to listen to them all and making sure they are worthy of going to the jukebox.
I should have a vote system or feedback? At least to help remove any songs that might not be up anymore, hmm.

**Cypress**
Preparing the error testing and making sure that the tests will work.
