## Notes

## 2025

### M4 Pro

-   05:26PM

    Laptop has been returned, I will miss all but with the $5500 back in my pockets, I will just invest it.
    My score for the laptop will be a 9 out of 10, it still is the best laptop on the market but definitely overkill for almost everyone.
    I did not get a chance to try OBS streaming on it, but the next time I get the M5 laptop, I will.

### Github Actions Rewrite

-   06:45PM

    The actions should be ready by tonight, there are only a couple more things to resolve before we are back to a full scale pipeline.
    Biggest issue right now is the token management and the 2nd biggest issue is the file alter triggers, both of which are just time based.

## 2024


### Phaser

The majority of this day will be preparing the game jam and making sure everyone is on board!
The VS Code live share does make it easier, to be honest. I think all software should be done in a duo.
Having a buddy while doing any type of software is a huge benefit, I think pair programming should be the future, add in an AI bot or two and now you have a full team.



### JSON 

The JSON Map is what holds all the information for the tileset and editing the game/map data directly through the tileset editor, [Map Editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled?ac=MbLnMaiNXvG) and [Dev Tools](https://github.com/zewa666/grid-engine-devtools).


### Vite

There is still an issue with the vite bundler and the pathing, which I still need to resolve for the `https://kbve.com/tools/travelbox` deployment!
The best move might be to deploy the assets using an absolute location from a s3 bucket.
