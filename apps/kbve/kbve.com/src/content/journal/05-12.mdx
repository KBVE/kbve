### KBVE Rewrite

-   02:00PM

    After thinking it through, the issue might be a silent vite problem with svelte 5 and the pre and post processing.
    Moving forward, I will try to write libraries to be framework agonstic, avoiding the issue of svelte or react migrations.
    The whole moving from react 18 to react 19 was a huge pain, having to do a svelte 4 to svelte 5 would just make it worse.
    There are migration scripts out there but honestly after doing the axum migrations, it feels like I am not moving fast enough to keep up with the breaking changes.

    The first step would be to build the meta file for the layout!
    Here we can focus on the meta title and description, but also the social information and og tags.
    This should not be too hard to setup.

### Droid Lib

-   04:58PM

    Taking a quick break from the astro situation before having to do a refactor for it!
    The droid library was something that I wanted to do for a while now, and I been getting better at using javascript workers.
    The goal would be a modular worker collection with service, shared and dedicated workers that all handle different tasks.
    I will try to build this out without causing too many issues down the road.
    On a side note, I do hate having to write tests but it is what it is.

-   06:39PM

    Adding the module support for the droids library will make it easier to then load the supabase and phaser as workers.
    This means that in the future, we can setup a pretty fast and isolated worker system that gives us a vast amount of flexibility.
    There is a down side, since there is no free lunch, which is that there will be a slight delay between loading the modules and the actual events.
    One way to handle this would be to run our own internal event engine that then would make things even more modular and easier to work with?
    Let me think this through before I go any further, I might loop back to the KBVE rewrite.

## 2024

**Happy Mothers Day**

We did a quick calendar event with the family!
I started to do this thing where I buy a bunch of different slices of cake, that way we can have a bit of each kind.
All the cakes except the carrot were on point.


**Cypress**

I fixed up the Cypress testing for KBVE.com and now I am going to deploy the github action under the beta branch to perform the tests.
Having AI help with building out the test cases is huge for development.
No one ever wants to write the different unit tests and integration testing, but AI is nearly perfect with helping build the different test case functions.
Now let us see if it performs well with this next couple git code pushes.

**Updates**

I made a quick list of all the updates that the monorepo needs, but I will hold some of those updates back to avoid breaking anything.
