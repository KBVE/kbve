## Pirate 17

### Preamble

    The time has arrived for the next major gamejam!
    We can start the team structure and prepare the 5 man squad, ideally with a solid gameplan too.
    Before the jam starts, I think we should make sure everything is operational, including the GDD format and markdown components.

### UIUX

    Since we dont have a theme yet, this can be skipped for now.

#### Colors

    Just a placeholder for that part.

### Assets

    We will most likely use Azure to hold the assets but I am sure there might be a better way to handle this.

### DevLog

    The Pirate 17 devlog, oh boi.


## Pirate 16

### Preamble 16

    The Pirate 16 Game Jam theme is “You Are The Weapon” and now we are the gods.
    Turns out we had a bit of a different gameplan, ended up switching from Unity to Godot, so most of this turned out to be useless for this jam.

### Assets 16

    We will be using the [Corgi Engine with Unity](/application/unity/#corgi).

    For the base UI assets, we will grab some examples from [Itch](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-unity/tag-user-interface).

    Trees were added from [Stylized Nature Mega Kit](https://quaternius.itch.io/stylized-nature-megakit)
    
    Note: We removed this -> Now going to try and add the [Ultimate Platformer Pack](https://quaternius.itch.io/ultimate-platformer-pack)

#### Environment 16

    End of the Game Portal from [the Gateway](https://painartio.itch.io/the-gateway).
    Might as well grab some kenny assets, the first will be the [survival kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/survival-kit)

### DevLog 16

    The Dev cycle of webgl and unity is always a pain!

    01/18/2025 - 07:35AM - Still need to figure out the joysticks.
