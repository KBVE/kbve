## 2024

**Redis**

Time to double check our build for the kilobase but this time on the macbook.

**Cargo**

Looks like we have to restructure the way that we handle version bumping because its causing our packages to break during test casing.
We will do the version bumps manually rather than automatically for now because the errors are a bit out of my scope.
Ugh, the migration to Nx v20 has been such a pain, I am almost reaching the burnout zone of programming.

Not too sure how I got around resolving this issue but we dropped a bunch of reference points and were able to get to functional build.
It involved cleaning up all of our cargo and then running a fetch again.

```shell
cargo clean
sudo rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry
cargo update
cargo fetch
```

There was a bunch of looping and cargo lock removing but we got past that hurdle.
Since the supabase docker image is ubuntu 20, we need to drop down the pgrx from `0.12.3` to `0.11.3`.

```shell
cargo install cargo-pgrx --version 0.11.3 --locked
```

What a pile of donkeys splat, had to downgrade back to v1.2.0 for the Rust monodon package to even get our basic builds to work.
This means even at v2.0, we are unable to have stable rust builds, gah!

Well with the version downgrade, we are making some progress.

```

```

Now we will wrap back around and look through the code again tomorrow, making adjustments to the SQL tables that and some of the logic.

**Expo**

Time to take a break from the rust code and take a look at our Expo configuration.
We have a couple things that we will have to change, including the bbq extension, which has still a bit of cookin left on it.
The command to start expo will be like this:

```shell

pnpm nx start expo-lcagents

```

Next we will take a look at the current source and I believe the theme needs to be defined again.
We can double check the tamagui version, I believe that it needs to be updated as well.
Bumping the tamagui to version 1.115.3, but there should not be other major upgrade yet.
I believe expo could be bumped up but we can wait on that until the iOS and Android pipelines are ready.

Okay the first issue was the dark mode, we want that to be default for right now.
This will be a quick fix and should not cause any major problems, we just flip the logic that would apply the default theme of light to dark.
We can do this inside of the `_layout.tsx` and that solves the dark theme issue.
Next we want to solve the double root problem, this can be done by removing the register root and just export the app with the expo-root.
Okay so we no longer see any errors in the web version, I did not yet test this on the iOS version but we can look at that later on.


**ExpoDoctor**

Since I am using a new laptop, there will be some plugins that are missing that need to be installed.
The shell that we could use to verify that is:

```shell

pnpm npx expo-doctor

```

I also believe that the nx monorepo provides another way to call the expo doctor, but regardless, I do not have the data rates to download all the files that we would need to fix this issue.
When I get back home, I will begin the process of setting up the iOS on the new m3 macbook.

**BBQ**

The next component that I want to add into the bbq would be an account or profile card, but we also need to configure the register and login?
Thinking through what would be the best option for setting up the register / login, I guess since we are using the tamagui, we can just wrap each of the component pieces with generic components.
The customization will be isolated from the smaller component pieces, so we should not have any issues.
To get 

**Kube**

While setting up the expo again, it would be wise to take a look at the kube health, making sure that everything is still functional.
I am going to run the `kubectl get pods -n supabase`, which returns a great status of everything running the past 12 days without any major errors or restarts.
With the version of kilobase v15.1.10 getting ready, we want to prepare a rolling cluster update.


**hCaptcha**

The next issue that we want to tackle is the loading of the hCaptcha within the react native / expo eco-system.
It looks like to grab the library, we will have to do this:

```
pnpm install @hcaptcha/react-native-hcaptcha
```

Then setup a new component, we can call it `hCaptchaWrapper` that would invoke either of the two units based upon if its web or not?
I suppose this would be easier since we can throw that into the BBQ and then reutilize or extend it out based upon how we want to integrate the supabase instance.
For this situation, we will try to avoid placing kilobase directly into this expo logic and just wrap around the supabase too.
Hmm, okay let me quickly build this component out inside of the bbq package and ship that out.

**DanDaDan**

Nothing says Thursday than a fresh episode of Dan Da Dan?
After driving around and touching enough grass, I think it would be great to spend the night just programming away and throwing on a series to stream.

**API**

We can deprecate and remove the `api` component within our apps folder.
Since this application was over a year ago and I have improved a bunch within the rust realm, it would be safe for us to remove it and replace it.
With that being said, right before we do that migration out and kill it, I should prepare the `kiloedge` instance and make sure that we can deploy edge functions through our self hosted instance of Supabase.
The way that we will build those self hosted functions, hmm, it would be to just grab the current version of the supabase edge instance within our docker image.
After grabbing it, we git copy the functions that we want to migrate over to it and then finally build a final image.
Could throw the cache into there too and make sure everything is included, then making it a read-only application would be our next logical step.
