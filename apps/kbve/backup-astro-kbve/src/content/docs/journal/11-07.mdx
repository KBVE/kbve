## 2024

    **Astro**

    We got the `rareicon.com` to build and run under the dev without any major issues.
    However there are some issues with the threejs when trying to run the kbve under the custom astro command.
    Finally, we got the base of the astro to build and now we can bring back the main pipeline!
    We had almost three full weeks of down time but we did get a good list of packages to clean up.
    I will make new issue tickets for the packages that we might have to remove.

    **TSLA**

    Oh no! Almost the $300 mark!?
    We got two more days before those options expire, I am just hoping it does not cross the $300 mark and praying that we get a bit of room to extend out those calls.

    **Herbmail**

    We can keep it astro based but the template should be fixed up and replaced again.
    Yet before we do that , we need to adjust the astro build process for it as well.
    The changes will be the same as the other astro config changes we made earlier, so it should be quick.

    **Nx**

    Updating the nx instance to version `v20.0.11` and now looping back around and making sure that everything else works.
    There were some issues with the out-dated plugins but we can address them later this week.

	**ShadCN**

	Time to get the herbmail frontpage converted over to a shadcn based template.
	I wonder if we could do it all through chatgpt?
	Wild that in almost 2025 and the astro icons is still broken and not working out of the box?
	I am somewhat surprised that I might have to create and publish a working astro package for icons.
