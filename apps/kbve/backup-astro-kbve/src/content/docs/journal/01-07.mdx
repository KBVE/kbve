## Notes

Lucky 7 of the first.

    **SPY**

    Damn I am still bag holding a bunch of spy, hopefully I can offload them before the end of this month.

    **Python**

    The best way to handle the supabase jwts, hmm.
    One idea would be to just pass the JWT secret over and use that to validate the information.
    
    We ended up going HAM!
    A huge chunk of the code has been updated and now we can almost see a production ready server live within the next week.
    There are a couple things that still need to be fixed but that should not be an issue, we just need to tackle it all slowly.


## 2024

-   12:38am - There are a couple library names that I wanted to use for the `egui` and `wasm` build, but I think I might go with `wasm-bosm`.
    I am also thinking maybe there might be a play on words that I could use?
    The library or crate that I am going to write would be based upon `egui` and `eframe`, so the traditional route would be to use that `e` type beat.
-   2:30pm - I will have to create a new ticket for tracking the CryptoThrone development:
    The ticket would be something like this:

        -   This will be a small WASM based game that we can develop on the side.

        -   The premise of the game is still under development but the goal would be to test cases some of the general WASM libraries while providing a flexible learning prod cycle.

        -   This issue ticket will be for keeping track of the development of CT.

        -   It seems that I was not able to get the direct `CNAME` setup for the `https://api.cryptothrone.com` and had to use an A record, but I believe there might be a way to handle this?
            I guess it might be because of the security structure that is in place, we could also setup a proxy and have that be the endpoint that we could use in the future.
            The error that it threw was `Error 1014: CNAME Cross-User Banned in Cloudflare` when using the CNAME.

    However I do not want to extend too far out right now and try to keep focus with getting the WASM library up and running.

-   Continued:

    -   My current research has taken me into the tauri, trunk and egui realm of the WASM.

    -   I am debating how I would want to build out the WASMs and have something that might be production ready, but I might just make a couple test case examples.

    -   The CORS needs to be fixed for the API, maybe instead of hard coding the CORS, I could just load them from the database?

    -   This would mean that I would have to create a new table, hmm.
        We could also just store the CORS as a global key, so that it would be something along the lines of `cors_$slot` , thus we could parse through the whole global table, looking for any instance of the `cors_$` and then parse the value it holds as the CORS domain?
        This would mean we would not have to add a whole new table just for the CORS? Most applications or API backends would not have more than a couple domains, so for us to over extend might not make the most sense.

-   MDX Migrations:

    -   Besides migrating over a bunch of the MDX documents, I believe I will drop `strapi` and `supabase` for the time being from the migration.
        I am just using this as a reference to keep track of the documents that I have skipped.
