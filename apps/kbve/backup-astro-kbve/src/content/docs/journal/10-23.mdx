## 2024

**Optimization**

There seems to be an issue with the optimization build that appears on a couple different browsers.
It is even worse because I still do not understand the whole query system for the design but besides that point, there are a couple concepts that also do not really make sense.
There is a part of me that wants to believe that I understand the react render but then there is a whole another part of me that is a bit confused.
We know that react is a virtual dom, yadadada, I have read and seen enough to understand those parts but when trying to build a unified codebase, the errors start to make less cents.

**Ensure Safe State**

Maybe we need to wrap back around the core of the component and make sure that we are using a safe state management?
It would not hurt for us to make sure that we keep track of the state, definitely when rendering and moving around a single page application, hmm.
For this we can take a based approach of using a reference for the component itself and then.
We could update both the `TamaLogin.tsx` and the `TamaRegister.tsx` so that they have callbacks that we can control when utilizing these components.
So the next update will be passing through the callback function and adding more references with mount / state control within the code.
This should provide us with some stability and help with future components, I suppose we could also factor into a `Food.tsx` component that handles all of this for us? 
That means we call -> Food.tsx =>> passing through the generic-T child components and handling the state , but that might just be too much nesting.  

**Tesla** 

What a wild earnings call!
I was expecting the stock to actually drop to sub $180s, but this was a surprise turn of events?
Could investors see the energy business side of Tesla booming with in the next couple years?

**HellBoy**

Well we were playing deadlock a bit earlier in the day and the Abrams character gives me the hellboy vibes.
We decided to step back in time, almost two decades and rewatch the first hellboy movie!
The whole movie was a blast.

Well movie night did not end there, we decided to watch the witch afterwards, which was decent.
I give hellboy a 5 out of 10 and the witch was a 6 out of 10.

The witch had amazing scenes but they did end it a bit too early, there should have been more world building. 
As for hellboy, damn I am so upset because the dark horse comics are filled with so much material, kinda lackluster that they dropped the ball on the story.

**Sheets**

Migrated over the sheets.
I am test casing the new sheets on the login page for expo-lcagents but while I am testing that, I am also reading further into the sheet mounts.
There is a part of me that is thinking that the react 301 bug might be something completely different but I am really hoping that it will be just from this mount issue.
It could have been from the way we were importing the Scroll view, instead of calling it from tamagui, we were calling it directly from react native. 
Hmm, regardless, we have 23 more components to build out and convert to BBQ templates.
