    **RPI**

    This is the first journal entry from the RPI!
    We were not able to get it working through the elemental os but I think that might be because there just is not enough documentation on it for now?
    Regardless, I think it might just be better to run ubuntu for on the RPI and maybe try to do the `k2d` or some other `edge` setup.
    I will put more notes down for this situation later today.

    **Unity**

    Going to spend the next couple hours going through Unity and seeing what changes that I have to do tonight.
    I believe we last left off with the discord integration and the AStar pathing.
    First error with the JavascriptFFI, seems that there was a duplicate function name, so I am going to adjust for that next.

    **RareIcon**

    Moving forward, we should just use the gihtub actions to execute the unity builds because the amount of time is just insane from the unity side.
    We are already looking at over 1:22 hours for this most recent build and I am thinking that something else might be wrong?
    Should the linking take this long, it just seems way too insane and maybe it be better to just let the actions handle it moving forward.
