## Notes

## 2025

-   **Helm**

    04:53PM

    Going to finish up the helm chart and then we can move forward.
    The `pydiscordsh-main.yaml` is almost done, we just need to fix the ingress.
    After finishing up the ingress and before the end of the night, I need to configure the sealed secrets.

```shell

        ./kbve.sh -nx kilobase:seal --namespace=discordsh --keyName=discord-turso --secrets=""

```

-   **WoW**

    07:10PM

    Some quick hardcore afk game play!
    I am thinking that it will be a bit rough to do on the side, while still programming.

-   **Car**

    09:00PM

    Car battery should be charged!
    Went out in the cold, got some greek yogurt and everything seems charged.

-   **Deployment**

    11:52PM
    
    The deployment of `PyDiscordSh` is below:
    
    Repo: `https://github.com/KBVE/kbve.git`
    Branch : `dev`
    Paths: `/migrations/kube/charts/discordsh`

    There were some 503 errors but we were able to get everything wired!


## 2024

    -   3:03pm - `erust` library
        After test casing the `apps/rust_wasm_embed` , I want to move some of the `egui` functions into the `erust` library / packages / crate, so that I can use them in multiple applictions.
        The first module inside of the `erust` library will be the `ironatom.rs`.
        I will migrate some of the generic boilerplate into this module and test case the build from that aspect.

    -   4:16pm - `debug`
        I was able to split the application and library, now I am going to add state management inside of the `erust` library.
        During the debug stage, I went ahead and split the codebase up, as planned and started to build out widgets for the `erust` application.
        One of the next objectives would be to integrate some images into the WASM, including the background.
        I would like it so that the user has some integration settings but that might have to be done later on.

        Two additional libraries that I wanted to add were:
        `reqwest`, at version 0.11 and `image`.
