    **Fudster**

    Moving over the java files and preparing the dockerfile for building.
    Lets create a quick list of the python libraries that we will need?

    - fastapi
    - uvicorn
    - broadcaster
    - websockets (maybe we might not need it?)
    - anyio
    - aiohttp

    We will run this command to add fastapi:

    ```shell

    pnpm nx run fudster:add --name "fastapi[standard]"

    ```

    This will grab us a bunch of files that we can use for deploying the api in python.
    Cleaned up some of the additional files and we got a solid build, yessir!

    **Websockets**

    I am currently restructuring the way we would handle the webscokets, because we need to still make it a bit more flexible yet not over do it.
    Let us start with the base level of the socket management and then we can start to expand upon it.

    **Orb**

    To speed up the docker build process, I added a quick orb command.

    ```shell
    ./kbve.sh -nx fudster:orb
    ```
    
    This command will build the fudster container and then use the docker run command to turn it online.
    The goal would be to make testing slight changes easier, I might even go a step further and setup live rebuilds and reloads.
