## Notes

## 2025

-   **WebGL**

    12:10AM

        Fixing up the webgl build so that it has a bit better performance and making sure that it loads smoothly!
        Okay we were able to resolve a decent amount of the issues but the mac builds still have issues, ugh.

    04:39AM

        Nevermind, I seem have made loading worse, ugh.
        Maybe its because I have the progress manager being called twice, hmm?
        Okay, let me go ahead and do a quick rebuild.

    07:52AM

        Break from the normal flow of C# and do some quick rust!
        We will build the game server out following our same strat as rareicon.

```shell

pnpm nx g @monodon/rust:binary rust_p16_gameserver --directory=apps/rust_p16_gameserver

```

## 2024

-   **Movement**

    8:30AM

        Going through the saber unity engine and comparing it against the RougeJester source code, trying to find a middle ground on how I should handle the movement.
        Besides refactoring the Camera, Entity system, Combat, the movement seems to be a bit jittery.
        I am thinking of creating a whole new movement script based upon the previous ones that we had written and maybe integrate the event system around it.
        There are a couple more concepts that I want to test out inside of an empty unity project and see if I can make any major break-throughs on how I am handling it.
        Do not even get me started on the physics engine, ugh.

-   **Branches**

    5:30PM

        I made an issue ticket going over the branch split, going to start writing out the Github actions for the branch split now.
        We would update the `ci-dev.yml` under the workflows, so that it does not pull to main anymore and goes to Alpha.
        After copying over and creating the `ci-alpha.yml`, I had to go back and remove the Saber build that was there under the `ci-dev.yml`.

-   **Warcraft**

    9:05PM

        In between the programming and test casing, I am still leveling up my druid!
        I am close to hitting level 24, then just need to do a bit more to hit the level cap of 25.
        Super excited to venture into the battle grounds as a druid, hopefully I do not get ran through like earlier.
        The WSG is still in my blood, capture the flag for life, kill all the horde! Muahahaha.
