## 2024

**Auth**

Back to focusing on the paraops, getting the base of the unity auth built out, so that that it can help with the user sign in.
We can also place some safety measures around the unity auth, so that if `window.Vuplex` is not found, it would not send the postmessage with the JWT?
I still have to work around the exact way that we could handle this, but I do want to get it all done by tonight.

**Steam Pipeline**

While building out the rest of the auth system, I want to go back and restructure the github actions yaml for building the unity game's pipeline.

**CI Patch**

The `ci-patch` workflow started to fail and it might be because of package conflicts between the main monorepo and the current dependencies under the `@kbve/devops`.
Thus to address this, we will have to find a couple different routes!
The most likely reason we are having this issue is because the `deps` between the package and the monorepo are outdated.
This will be something that I can address but lets see if we can isolate that issue?
I am going to move the action out of the `monorepo` and into its own independant folder.
