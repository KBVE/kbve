## Notes

## 2025

-   02:40PM

    **HardCore**

    Got to the barrens today but its been rough, I am alone in the wasteland!
    I hope that the fellow guildmates reach the course of the level.

-   06:10PM

    **Abilities**

    Healing! A core of the gameplay is what we need to build now!
    The issue ticket that we are currently handling is [3651](https://github.com/KBVE/kbve/issues/3651).
    
-   08:05PM

    **Twitch**

    While working through the AOE spells, I thought it be cool to work on the twitch stream!

## 2024

-   11:00am - Going to aim at getting out of work earlier than before but I have some issues to prepare for, including being assigned to AAPL at $190.
    I will have to prepare around $38K to offset the 200 shares of AAPL from the two puts.

-   11:54am - Out of lunch and going to start doing the `GlobalStyles.tsx` for the `js-embed-passport`.
    I am going to migrating out the `KB.tsx` into its own JS/TS library, so that I can call it from anywhere.
    We can call the library, `KhashVault` and have it serve as the cache for the nanostorage.

-   12:18pm - Now I am looking into the bundler for the custom library that I am going to be using.
    For the vite bundler, we could use the nx generator via this command:

          ```shell
              pnpm nx g @nx/js:lib khashvault  --directory packages/khashvault --bundler=vite
          ```
          Including the Nx 18 command for deriving the name / root.

    For the vite test casing, it seems that we would have to configure the `vite-plugin-dts`, this is a vite plugin that generates declaration files `*.d.ts`.

    To make sure that we have the plugin installed, we would run this command:

          ```shell
              pnpm i vite-plugin-dts -D
          ```

    After the plugin has been installed, it would be wise to reset the monorepo, with this command:

          ```shell
              ./kbve.sh -reset
          ```

    Okay to run the test casing for the library, we will use this command:

          ```shell
              pnpm exec nx run khashvault:test
          ```

          The `khashvault` is the name of the library that we just created.

    Going to migrate the `storage.ts` from the `Astro-ve` to the new `KhashVault` library that we are building.

-   7:31pm - The protobuf integration first requries having the right library installed.
    For the WSL/Ubuntu:
    `shell
          sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
      `
    After the compiler is added and installed, we will check the version, with this command:

          ```shell
                  protoc --version
          ```

          This should return something along this line:
              `libprotoc 3.12.4`

    This library will be used to help automate the protobuf types for javascript/typescript.

-   10:17pm - To automatically generate the protos, we are using the diesel_ext.
    The command that we are going to run is:
    `shell
          diesel_ext --proto > src/kbveproto.proto
      `
    However upon the generation, there were three TODO errors that appear in the proto.
    An example of it would be: - `TODO: unknown type Binary`

-   10:44pm - The current solution might be to just run sed after the generation to fix some of the generated files.
    It seems that I forgot to remove the `Identifiable` from the `derive` but need to account for the commas.
    So here the is the shell command that I will add into the kbve shell.

          ```shell
              sed -i -e 's/#[derive(.*,\s*)Identifiable,\s*(.*)]/#[derive(\1\2)]/g' -e 's/#[derive(.*),\s*Identifiable\s*]/#[derive(\1)]/g' your_file.rs
          ```
          This was giving some issues with the regex of the comma, so I decided to just remove the instance with `, Identifiable`.
          I will come back to this issue later on.

          ```rust

          use crate::apikey::dsl::apikey;
          use crate::appwrite::dsl::appwrite;
          use crate::auth::dsl::auth;
          use crate::globals::dsl::globals;
          use crate::n8n::dsl::n8n;
          use crate::profile::dsl::profile;
          use crate::settings::dsl::settings;
          use crate::users::dsl::users;

          ```
          We will skip this part of the code block as well for now.

          The next two phases of the protobuf generation would be the `into_proto` and the `from_proto`.
          Both of these can be generated using `-f` and `-i` flags, like this:

              ```shell
                  diesel_ext -i -c class_name > src/into_proto.rs
                  diesel_ext -f -c class_name > src/from_proto.rs

              ```
                  Replacing the `class_name`.

          There are a couple errors that the CLI is throwing, which were similar to the ones with Binary types.
