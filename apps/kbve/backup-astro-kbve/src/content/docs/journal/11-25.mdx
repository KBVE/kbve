    **VContainers**

    Going to continue learning more about the containers and maybe get the first batch finished.
    If we can get the exisiting MM components to load under the VContainer, then it will make extending and gameplay so much easier.

    **Helm**

    Time to work out the helm chart!
    We want this helm chart deployment to be easy but also useful, I believe the websockets will be a breeze but the UDP might be an issue.
    Thanks to Fudster, we were able to move past my insecurities and resolve the issue.
    He is a great leader and knows how to get things done.

    **Unity**

    Updating the unity game and fixing the missing scenes from the game, almost as if ... uhh... I forgot to include the actual game.
    I think there might be a couple ways to improve the performance by lowering the light map and texture.
