## Information

Traefik is a cloud-hybrid reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying, configuring and integrating infrastructure components easy and automatic.

## Docker

Docker Compose - There should be an acme.json file that you create and pass through the docker with the permission of chmod 600. - Furthermore, there are two more files that you will have to configure and pass through before launching the traefik container. We provided them in the #config section below.

## Kubernetes

-   Patching Traefik on k3s cluster

    -   We want to find the instance of where traefik is running. Running `sudo kubectl get all -o wide --all-namespaces` should display all your containers, look for traefik.
    -   Patch

        -   ```shell
            sudo kubectl patch svc traefik -n kube-system -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Cluster"}}'`
            ```

    -   std output should be `service/traefik patched`

-   Helm Charts

    -   ```shell
        helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
        ```

        -   **Sucess**: std output should be

            -   ```shell
                "traefik" has been added to your repositories
                ```

    -   ```shell
        helm repo update
        ```

-   Traefik Middleware for Kubernetes

    -   Middleware kind should be isolated for performance and security reasons.

        -   Auth - Kind: Middleware

            -   Example:

                -   ```yaml
                    apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
                    kind: Middleware
                    metadata:
                        name: longhorn-auth
                        namespace: longhorn-system
                    spec:
                        basicAuth:
                            secret: authsecret
                    ```

                    -   The middleware should be saved as a yaml / yml file and applied using kubectl.

        -   Auth - Kind: Ingress

            -   Calling the `longhorn-auth` in the `Ingress` via `annotations`:

                -   Example:

                    -   ```yaml
                        apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
                        kind: Ingress
                        metadata:
                            name: longhorn-ing-traefik
                            namespace: longhorn-system
                            annotations:
                                externalTrafficPolicy: Local
                                kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
                                traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: longhorn-system-longhorn-auth@kubernetescrd
                                ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-x-forwarded-for: 'true'

                        spec:
                            rules:
                                - host: 'x.kbve.com'
                                  http:
                                      paths:
                                          - path: /
                                            pathType: Prefix
                                            backend:
                                                service:
                                                    name: longhorn-service-provider
                                                    port:
                                                        number: 8000
                        ```

                    -   In our PoC above, we see that the middleware is referenced as:

                        ```yaml
                        traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.middlewares: longhorn-system-longhorn-auth@kubernetescrd
                        ```

                        Its important to note the namespace of the middleware, `longhorn-system` , before calling the middleware's name. This is to let the crd know where the middleware is located.

## Notes

[According to the notes on Traefik & Kubernetes](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-crd/)
we first need to install the Resource Definitions and RBAC into `kubectl` by running the following commands:

```shell
# Install Traefik Resource Definitions:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traefik/traefik/v2.8/docs/content/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd-definition-v1.yml

# Install RBAC for Traefik:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traefik/traefik/v2.8/docs/content/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd-rbac.yml

```

After this installation, we'll have a set of [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
which should have the following benefits:

-   The usage of `name` and `namespace` to refer to another Kubernetes resource.
-   The usage of [secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) for sensitive data (TLS certificates and credentials).
-   The structure of the configuration.
-   The requirement to declare all the [definitions](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/dynamic-configuration/kubernetes-crd/#definitions).

See the list of CRDs in the dedicated [routing section](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/).

The biggest thing we need from this is the ability to add the [BasicAuth](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth/) plugin.
This plugin (which is what we tried to reference before with the `auth@file` line) uses an htpasswd password to block incoming traffic to the pod.

This will require setting up an IngressRoute (which is a specific Kubernetes resource added by the Traefik Resource Definitions) with settings to specify
what the middlewares are. [Find more info on the Traefik Middlewares Here](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/overview/)

## Cloudflare

These are notes on integrating `Cloudflare` with `Traefik`, including automating some of the actions so that you may not have to repeat them.

### Acme Docs

[Official Docs](https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/cloudflare/#api-tokens)

Access the API Tokens directly from [Cloudflare Profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)

Common environmental variable names and their purpose:

-   `CF_API_EMAIL` - The Cloudflare account holder's email.
-   `CF_API_KEY` - The Cloudflare API key.
-   `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` - The API token with `DNS:Edit` permission.
-   `CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN` - The API token with `Zone:Read` permission.
