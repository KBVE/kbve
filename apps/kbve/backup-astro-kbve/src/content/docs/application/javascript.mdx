    Read on, discover the secrets of design patterns and experience the magic and potential of design patterns for yourself below.

### Design Patterns

    The theory of javascript design patterns can be classified into three major categories, namely creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
    These classes differ from each other in various distinctions and aspects, such as how complex and elaborate the pattern is, the level of detail it offers to the developer and end-user, and the scope of its impact on the system being designed.
    Understanding these divisions can help developers choose the most suitable design pattern for their specific needs and goals within the application, interface or project.

### Creational Design Patterns

    Creational patterns enable a more adaptable and reusable code by offering a flexible framework for creating objects or classes.
    In this nature, the design shields the users from the complex construction process and streamline their interaction with the classes.
    Thus, the pattern controls the user-class interaction and save the developers from handling complex construction.

    Factories, builders and singletons are the three core concepts of creational design pattern.

### Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a fundamental component of creational patterns that offers a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories with a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
This pattern is especially useful in systems that need to be independent of how their products are created, composed, and represented.

#### Purpose

The Abstract Factory pattern is designed to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
It allows a system to be independent of how its products are created, composed, or represented.
This pattern is beneficial for systems that require the flexibility to deal with diverse objects sharing a thematic or functional link.

#### Implementation

The pattern involves several key components:

-   **Abstract Factory**: An interface that declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products.
-   **Concrete Factory**: Implements the abstract factory methods to create concrete products.
-   **Abstract Product**: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
-   **Concrete Product**: Implements the abstract product interface; objects created through a factory.
-   **Client**: Uses only interfaces declared by Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes.

#### Scenario and Example

Consider a scenario where a software developer is tasked with creating a cross-platform application that needs to generate various user interface components like buttons, modals, forms, text boxes, and menus.
By employing the Abstract Factory, the developer can define an interface for creating these UI elements which can then be implemented by different concrete factories for specific platforms (e.g., Windows, Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux).

<Aside type="tip">

Simplified JavaScript example illustrating this concept:

```js
// Abstract Factory
class GUIFactory {
	createButton() {}
	createTextbox() {}
}

// Concrete Factory for Windows
class WindowsFactory extends GUIFactory {
	createButton() {
		return new WindowsButton();
	}
	createTextbox() {
		return new WindowsTextbox();
	}
}

// Concrete Factory for MacOS
class MacOSFactory extends GUIFactory {
	createButton() {
		return new MacOSButton();
	}
	createTextbox() {
		return new MacOSTextbox();
	}
}

// Abstract Products
class Button {
	render() {}
}
class Textbox {
	render() {}
}

// Concrete Products for Windows
class WindowsButton extends Button {
	render() {
		console.log('Rendering Windows button');
	}
}
class WindowsTextbox extends Textbox {
	render() {
		console.log('Rendering Windows textbox');
	}
}

// Concrete Products for MacOS
class MacOSButton extends Button {
	render() {
		console.log('Rendering MacOS button');
	}
}
class MacOSTextbox extends Textbox {
	render() {
		console.log('Rendering MacOS textbox');
	}
}

// Client code
function renderUI(factory) {
	const button = factory.createButton();
	button.render();
	const textbox = factory.createTextbox();
	textbox.render();
}

const windowsFactory = new WindowsFactory();
const macFactory = new MacOSFactory();

renderUI(windowsFactory);
renderUI(macFactory);
```

**Abstract Factory Pattern Quick Tip:**

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when you need to ensure that your application can create and manage families of related or dependent products, or when you want to provide a library of products without exposing the implementation details.
This pattern not only fosters system scalability and interchangeability but also promotes consistency among products.

</Aside>

#### Advantages

-   **Flexibility**: Allows the creation of sets of related products without specifying their concrete classes.
-   **Scalability**: Supports adding new kinds of products without disturbing existing client code.

<Aside type="caution">

**Warning: Abstract Factory Pattern Use**

While the Abstract Factory pattern is powerful for promoting consistency among products and managing families of related objects, be cautious of its complexity. Overusing the pattern can lead to overly complicated designs that might be difficult to understand and maintain. It's particularly important to assess whether the benefits of abstracting factory creation truly outweigh the additional overhead. This pattern is most beneficial when your system genuinely requires a diverse range of objects with shared characteristics or when you need to enforce a particular set of design constraints across various product families.

#### Asbtract Factory Tutorial

<Steps>

1.  **Define Abstract Factory Interface:**

        Create an interface for the abstract factory. This interface will declare methods for creating each type of vehicle.

        ```js

        class VehicleFactory {
        createCar() {}
        createBoat() {}
        }

        ```

2.  **Create Concrete Factory Classes:**

        Implement concrete factories that extend the abstract factory interface. Each factory will provide specific implementations for creating vehicles suitable for its environment.

        ```js

            class LandVehicleFactory extends VehicleFactory {
                createCar() {
                    return new Sedan();
                }
                createBoat() {
                    return new Canoe(); // Just for demonstration, usually wouldn't be in LandVehicleFactory
                }
            }

            class WaterVehicleFactory extends VehicleFactory {
                createCar() {
                    return new AmphibiousCar();
                }
                createBoat() {
                    return new SpeedBoat();
                }
            }


        ```

3.  **Define Abstract Product Interfaces**:

        Define interfaces for each type of vehicle. These interfaces will include methods that all concrete vehicle products must implement.

        ```js

        class Car {
            drive() {}
        }

        class Boat {
            sail() {}
        }

        ```

4.  **Create Concrete Product Classes**:

        Implement the product interfaces with concrete classes. These classes will define the specific characteristics of vehicles.

        ```js

        class Sedan extends Car {
            drive() {
                console.log("Driving a sedan on roads");
            }
        }

        class Canoe extends Boat {
            sail() {
                console.log("Canoeing in calm waters");
            }
        }

        class AmphibiousCar extends Car {
            drive() {
                console.log("Driving an amphibious car on land and water");
            }
        }

        class SpeedBoat extends Boat {
            sail() {
                console.log("Speeding through water with a speedboat");
            }
        }

        ```

5.  **Implement Client Code**:

        Write the client code that utilizes the factories to create objects. The client should interact with these objects through their abstract interfaces.

        ```js

        function testVehicle(factory) {
            const car = factory.createCar();
            car.drive();
            const boat = factory.createBoat();
            boat.sail();
        }

        const landFactory = new LandVehicleFactory();
        const waterFactory = new WaterVehicleFactory();

        testVehicle(landFactory);
        testVehicle(waterFactory);

        ```

6.  **Test Your Implementation**:
    Test the implementation to confirm that the correct vehicle types are being created and that they behave as intended, ensuring that the factory logic correctly encapsulates the creation details.

        This example illustrates how the Abstract Factory pattern can be applied to a vehicle manufacturing scenario, facilitating the creation of products that are tailored for specific environmental conditions without exposing the creation logic to the client code.

### Builder

The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
By doing so, the same construction process can create different representations.
This pattern is particularly useful when an object must be created in multiple steps or with various configurations.

#### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Builder pattern is to allow the step-by-step construction of complex objects and to simplify the code by separating the construction of these objects from their class.
This pattern is ideal for situations where multiple versions of an object need to be created, and a clear method of doing so is necessary.

#### Implementation

The Builder pattern involves three key components:

-   **Builder**: This is an interface that defines all the steps required to build a part of the object.
-   **Concrete Builder**: Implements the builder interface and provides an implementation for those steps. It keeps track of the representation it creates and provides an interface for retrieving the product.
-   **Director**: Takes a builder instance and executes the necessary operations to produce a part of the object. The director knows which builder to use to get the desired object configuration.
-   **Product**: The complex object that is being built. The builder returns the product as a final step.

<Aside type="tip">

Example of Builder pattern implemented in JavaScript:

```js
class CarBuilder {
	constructor() {
		this.car = {};
	}

	addEngine(engine) {
		this.car.engine = engine;
		return this;
	}

	addWheels(wheels) {
		this.car.wheels = wheels;
		return this;
	}

	addDoors(doors) {
		this.car.doors = doors;
		return this;
	}

	build() {
		return this.car;
	}
}

// Director function to construct a sports car
function buildSportsCar(builder) {
	return builder.addEngine('V8').addWheels(4).addDoors(2).build();
}

// Usage
const builder = new CarBuilder();
const sportsCar = buildSportsCar(builder);
console.log(sportsCar);
```

</Aside>

#### Advantages

-   **Flexibility in Object Construction**: Builders can construct objects step-by-step, vary the process based on the situation, and easily create different types of objects with the same construction code.
-   **Encapsulation and Construction Control**: The product's internal representation is protected from the client until it is fully built. This encapsulation helps in maintaining the integrity of the constructed object.

#### When to Use

Use the Builder pattern when constructing a complex object with multiple optional and mandatory fields, or when an object must be assembled in multiple steps or configurations. It is also beneficial when you need a clear way to create different representations of the same class.

The Builder design pattern greatly enhances the modularity and readability of code, making it easier to write, maintain, and modify code where complex objects are involved.

### Singleton

Singleton is a design pattern that falls under the creational category, which concerns itself with the best ways to instantiate objects.
The core principle of the Singleton pattern is to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global point of access to that instance.
This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

The implementation of the Singleton pattern involves creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one does not already exist.
If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. To ensure that no other instances can be created, the constructor of the class is made private.

A typical use of the Singleton pattern is in managing a connection to a database or the settings in a configuration file.
By using a Singleton, multiple parts of an application can share a single connection or configuration object without the need to pass around a reference throughout the program.

Singletons also help in conserving system resources, as they avoid constant creation and destruction of objects when a single object is sufficient.
However, care must be taken with Singletons as they can introduce global state into an application, which can complicate testing and limit flexibility.

Overall, the Singleton pattern provides an elegant solution to ensuring a class has only one instance while offering a global point of access, thereby contributing to a cleaner and more manageable codebase.

<Aside type="tip">

JavaScript Example of Singleton

```js
class Database {
	static instance = null;

	constructor() {
		if (Database.instance) {
			return Database.instance;
		}
		Database.instance = this;
		this.connection = 'Connection established'; // Simulating a database connection
	}

	connect() {
		return this.connection;
	}
}

// Usage
const db1 = new Database();
const db2 = new Database();

console.log(db1 === db2); // Output: true
console.log(db1.connect()); // Output: Connection established
```

In this example, the **Database** class is designed such that it can only have one instance.
When an instance is created, it is stored in a static property. Any subsequent attempts to create new instances will return the original instance, ensuring that there is only one Database instance throughout the application.

**Singleton Pattern Quick Tip:**

When using the Singleton pattern, remember that it's best applied in scenarios where a single shared resource, like a database or configuration settings, needs to be managed consistently across an application.
However, be cautious of its impact on application design, as it can introduce a global state that might complicate testing and make the code less modular.
Always consider if the Singleton pattern is the best fit for your use case, particularly in environments where instance management is critical.

</Aside>

### Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns, SDP, are concerned with how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.

They help to ensure that changes in one part of the system do not affect other parts.

Structural Design Patterns (SDP) play a pivotal role in software architecture by focusing on how objects and classes can be assembled into larger and more complex structures.
These patterns aim to improve the design of a system by ensuring that the individual components can be combined in such a way that maintains both the individual integrity and the overall flexibility of the system.

SDP are instrumental in simplifying the structure by identifying the relationships between the entities.
This identification helps in facilitating better organization of the system components, making it easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Additionally, these patterns help in ensuring that changes in one part of a system do not adversely affect other parts, which is crucial for the stability and robustness of the system.

<Aside type="tip">

Examples of Structural Design Patterns include the Adapter pattern, which allows interfaces of different classes to work together despite incompatible interfaces; the Composite pattern, which enables the composition of objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies; and the Facade pattern, which provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, thereby reducing dependencies and minimizing the impact of changes.

```js
class OldInterface {
	constructor() {
		this.request = () => 'Old Interface: Processing request';
	}
}

class NewInterface {
	constructor() {
		this.specificRequest = () =>
			'New Interface: Processing specific request';
	}
}

class InterfaceAdapter {
	constructor(newInterface) {
		this.newInterface = newInterface;
	}

	request() {
		return this.newInterface.specificRequest();
	}
}

// Usage
const oldInterface = new OldInterface();
console.log(oldInterface.request()); // Output: Old Interface: Processing request

const newInterface = new NewInterface();
const adapter = new InterfaceAdapter(newInterface);
console.log(adapter.request()); // Output: New Interface: Processing specific request
```

In this example, the **InterfaceAdapter** class adapts the **NewInterface** so it can be used where the **OldInterface** is expected.
This is particularly useful in scenarios where parts of the software need to be upgraded or changed without disrupting existing code.

**Structural Design Pattern Quick Tip: Adapter Pattern**

The Adapter pattern is invaluable when integrating new components into existing systems where interfaces do not match.
It acts as a bridge, allowing different parts of a system to communicate seamlessly without requiring changes to their actual code.
Use the Adapter pattern to resolve compatibility issues while maintaining the integrity of the original system.
This pattern is a testament to the flexibility and adaptability of software, ensuring longevity and scalability.

</Aside>

By using these patterns, developers can create systems that are more modular and easier to manage, with well-defined interconnections between different components. Structural Design Patterns are essential for developers looking to build complex systems that require high levels of inter-component flexibility and maintainability.

### Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral Design Patterns, BDP, define the communication between objects and how they interact with each other.

They help to ensure that objects work together in a coordinated manner.

&emsp; &emsp; Behavioral Design Patterns (BDP) are crucial in the realm of software engineering, specifically focusing on improving the communication and interaction between objects in software systems.
These patterns facilitate a smooth and efficient orchestration of behaviors among different objects, enabling them to perform their tasks in a coordinated and cooperative manner.

&emsp; &emsp; These patterns are distinguished by their ability to distribute responsibilities among objects, which helps in reducing the complexity of the code and increasing its flexibility.
By defining standard communication protocols, BDP ensure that the objects can interact without being tightly coupled, thereby enhancing modularity and facilitating future scalability and maintenance.

Examples of Behavioral Design Patterns include the Observer pattern, which allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects without creating a direct dependency; the Strategy pattern, which enables the selection of an algorithm's behavior at runtime; and the State pattern, which allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

&emsp; &emsp; Implementing these patterns can lead to more dynamic and adaptable software, with components that are easier to understand, extend, or modify.
Behavioral Design Patterns are indispensable for developers aiming to create interactive systems that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.

## NodeJS

Node.js is a dynamic open-source runtime environment that brings JavaScript to the server side.
Running on Google's powerful V8 engine, it allows for both client and server-side application development using JavaScript.
This is streamlined by npm, Node's package manager, which hosts a vast repository of open-source libraries.

Often simply called "Node," this environment was created to extend the efficient and event-driven qualities of JavaScript beyond web browsers.
Node.js executes code using the V8 engine and is designed around an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that not only boosts efficiency but is also perfect for scalable and real-time applications.

Node.js really shines by bridging the gap between front-end and back-end development, allowing developers to work with JavaScript across the board.
This unity simplifies the development process and makes it more cohesive. Npm, Node’s package manager, plays a critical role by offering a wealth of open-source libraries that help developers quickly construct applications using modules shared by the community.

Node’s utility extends beyond typical web applications. It’s also used for developing command-line tools, chat applications, data-intensive real-time applications, and even for IoT devices.
With its continuous development, strong community support, and adaptability to modern development needs, Node.js is a prime example of how server-side development has transformed in the modern era.

### NodeJS Installation

Getting Started with Node.js Installation

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It allows developers to write server-side applications in JavaScript.
Installing Node.js is the first step towards using its rich ecosystem for developing web applications, REST APIs, and more.

**Choosing the Right NodeJS Version**

When planning to install Node.js, you have two main versions to consider:

-   **LTS (Long-Term Support)**: This version is best for most users, especially in production environments, because it receives security and stability updates for an extended period.
-   **Current**: This version includes the latest features and updates. It's suitable for developers who want to experiment with the newest capabilities of Node.js but might be less stable than the LTS version.

Using the LTS version ensures that you are working on a stable and well-supported platform, which is crucial for application stability and security.

<Aside title="Importance of Node.js Versions">

Node.js versions are important because of the following reasons:

-   **API Stability**: Different versions of Node.js may have varying API compatibilities. LTS versions guarantee backward compatibility with older stable APIs.
-   **Security**: Newer versions receive security updates that protect your application from vulnerabilities.
-   **Features**: Newer versions typically have new features that are not available or are backported to older versions. Using the current version allows developers to utilize the latest features.

</Aside>

**Version Management**

For managing multiple Node.js versions on a single machine, tools like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) for Unix-based systems or `nvm-windows` for Windows are highly recommended.
These tools allow you to switch between different Node.js versions easily, which is helpful when working on multiple projects that require different versions.

Here is how you can install `nvm`:

```bash
# Install nvm and use it to install Node.js
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
nvm use node
```

**Bun Docker**

Integrating Bun into a Docker environment provides a robust and scalable solution for deploying JavaScript and TypeScript applications.
Docker containers offer an isolated, consistent environment for applications, ensuring uniform operation across different deployment locations.
Developers gain significant advantages from Docker's encapsulation features combined with Bun's impressive performance capabilities.
Such a setup promotes easier version control, dependency management, and testing.
Leveraging Docker with Bun enhances the development to production workflow, minimizing discrepancies between environments and reducing deployment conflicts.
The abstraction layer simplifies configuration processes and boosts overall deployment efficiency and reliability.

<Aside type="note" title="Note: Bun Docker CLI">
	To utilize Bun within Docker, use the **oven/bun** image. Execute Bun
	commands using the following single command: ```shell docker run --rm
	oven/bun --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 --$command ```
</Aside>

**Bun DockerFile**

The Dockerfile sets up a more secure and structured environment for a Bun application.
It ensures that all files are neatly organized in a specific working directory (/app), dependencies are installed there, and the application is exposed on port 3000.
In addition, the DockerFile example below, addresses security best practices by running the application as a non-root user, which can help mitigate potential risks in production environments.

<Aside type="note" title="Note: Bun Dockerfile Example">

```dockerfile

# Use the latest oven/bun image
FROM oven/bun:latest

# Set the working directory in the Docker image
WORKDIR /app

# Copy necessary files to the working directory
COPY package.json ./
COPY bun.lockb ./
COPY src ./

# Install dependencies using Bun
RUN bun install

# Expose port 3000 for the application
EXPOSE 3000

# Create a new user to avoid running the app as root for security reasons
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser
USER appuser

# Command to run the application
CMD ["bun", "src/index.js"]

```

-   **Working Directory**: Ensure the **WORKDIR** is set to **/app**. This is crucial as all operations thereafter are based on this directory.
-   **Port Configuration**: Verify that the port **3000** is appropriate for your application. Adjust if a different port is required.
-   **Application Entry Point**: Confirm that **index.js** is the correct entry point for your application. This should be the main file where your app starts execution.

</Aside>

**Bun Upgrade**

To update Bun to the latest stable version, run the command bun upgrade in your terminal.
If you want to experiment with the newest features, you can install the Canary version by using the command bun upgrade --canary.
This will download and apply the latest experimental version available.

<Aside type="tip" title="Tips: Quick Bun Upgrade Command">

**Latest Version**

```shell
bun upgrade
```

**Canary Version**

```shell
bun upgrade --canary
```

## TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces without writing a single line of custom CSS. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide predefined components, Tailwind offers low-level utility classes that let developers compose and style elements directly in their markup.
This approach promotes consistency, reusability, and efficiency in styling, making it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs.
TailwindCSS also features a highly customizable configuration, enabling developers to tailor the framework to fit their specific design needs and preferences.

### TailWindCSS Setup

<Steps>

0.  **Create a New TailwindCSS Project Directory**

    Open your terminal and create a new directory for your tailwindcss project.
    Navigate into the directory.

    ```shell
    mkdir my-tailwind-project
    cd my-tailwind-project
    ```

    After creating the directory, go ahead and initialize a new pnpm project!

    ```shell
    pnpm init -y
    ```

1.  **Install TailwindCSS**

    You can use the npm or pnpm to install Tailwindcss.

    ```shell
    pnpm install tailwindcss
    ```

    After installing the `tailwindcss` package, go ahead and initialize the `tailwindcss` configuration with the command below.

    ```shell
    npx tailwindcss init
    ```

    This will generate a `tailwind.config.fs` file within your project root.

2.  **Configure TailwindCSS**:

    Create a directory for your CSS files (e.g., `src`).

    ```shell
    mkdir src
    ```

    Create a main CSS file (e.g., `src/styles.css`).

    ```shell
    touch src/styles.css
    ```

    After creating the `src/styles.css`, open it up and paste in the default Tailwind imports.

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

    Then update your `tailwind.config.js` file to specify the paths to all of your template files.
    This is necessary for purging unused styles in production.

    ```js
    module.exports = {
    	content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
    	theme: {
    		extend: {},
    	},
    	plugins: [],
    };
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Build Process**:

    To use TailwindCSS, you need to process your CSS file, we can use a couple different tools to help us.
    In the example below, we will use PostCSS but we can also use Webpack or ESBuild.

    Install PostCSS and Autoprefixer:

    ```shell
    pnpm install postcss postcss-cli autoprefixer
    ```

    Then create a PostCSS config file in your project root and add the following default configuration:

    ```js
    module.exports = {
    	plugins: {
    		tailwindcss: {},
    		autoprefixer: {},
    	},
    };
    ```

4.  **Build The CSS**:

    Update the `scripts` section in your `package.json` to include a build script:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "build:css": "postcss src/styles.css -o dist/styles.css"
    }
    ```

    Then to run the build script, we can execute the command below to generate the CSS files:

    ```shell
    pnpm build:css
    ```

5.  **Include the Compiled CSS in Your HTML**:

    Create an `index.html` file in your project root and include the compiled CSS file:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    	<head>
    		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
    		<meta
    			name="viewport"
    			content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    		<title>TailwindCSS Project</title>
    		<link href="dist/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    	</head>
    	<body>
    		<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello, TailwindCSS!</h1>
    	</body>
    </html>
    ```

6.  **Development Workflow**:

    If you have `serve` already installed, then you can run the serve from the `dist` directory.

    By default, `serve` will serve the contents of the current directory on port 3000.
    If you want to specify a different directory (e.g., `dist`), you can do so:

    ```shell
    serve dist
    ```

    Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your TailwindCSS project.

    You have successfully set up, installed, and configured TailwindCSS in your project.
    From here, you can start building and styling your web pages using Tailwind's utility classes.
    For more advanced configuration and customization, refer to the [official TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### TailWindCSS Animation

Animation Utility provides animating elements, which can be extended and abstractly layered through Rive/Lottie.

The default animations are:

-   `animate-spin` : Which uses a keyFrames spin to transform / rotate the object, primary use case is for loading indictions.

-   `animate-ping` : Uses transform to slowly scale out the element and create a radar / ripple effect upon the element, primary use case is for notifications.

-   `animate-pulse` : Alter the opacity of the element, to create a fading in and out effect, primary use case is for skeleton loaders.

-   `animate-bounce` : Transform the Y access of the element. primary use case is for aesthetics.

-   `hover:$animation` : Conditional statement, where if the mouse is over the element, perform the animation.

### TailWindCSS Spin-Slow

This is a custom animation that you can add to TailWindCSS by extending the animations field within the configuration file.

Scoped: `animation: { 'spin-slow': 'spin 5s linear infinite',  }`

Proof of Concept:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			animation: {
				'spin-slow': 'spin 5s linear infinite',
			},
		},
	},
};
```

## MUI

MUI, formerly known as Material-UI, stands as a prominent React UI framework that brings Google's Material Design principles to life.
Offering an extensive collection of React components and CSS-in-JS styling solutions, MUI enables developers to create responsive and visually consistent web applications with ease.
With its standardized design components and patterns, MUI ensures cohesive and professional user interfaces, making it an invaluable asset for modern web development.

### MUI Setup

<Steps>

0.  **Install PNPM (Optional)**:

    If pnpm is not already installed, you can install it globally using npm:

    ```shell
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```

1.  **Initialize Your Project**:

    Create a new project directory and initialize it with pnpm:

    ```shell
    mkdir my-mui-project
    cd my-mui-project
    pnpm init
    ```

2.  **Install React and React DOM**:

    Install React and React DOM, which are required for using MUI:

    ```shell
    pnpm add react react-dom
    ```

3.  **Install MUI Core**:

    Install the core MUI package and its dependencies:

    ```shell
    pnpm add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your Project Structure**:

    We will create a basic project structure for this MUI example!

    <FileTree>

    -   my-mui-project/
        -   public/
            -   index.html
        -   src/
            -   App.js
            -   index.js
            -   style.css
        -   package.json
        -   pnpm-lock.yaml
    -   README.md

    </FileTree>

    <Aside title="Note: MUI Project README">
        Use the README.md file to document your MUI project notes, installation steps, and any useful references for future development.

        Be sure to link back to this section :D

    </Aside>

5.  **Create an HTML File**:

    In the `public` directory, create an `index.html` file:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    	<head>
    		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
    		<meta
    			name="viewport"
    			content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    		<title>MUI Project</title>
    	</head>
    	<body>
    		<div id="root"></div>
    	</body>
    </html>
    ```

    <Aside title="Note: Understanding the HTML Code">

        ```html
        <div id="root"></div>
        ```
        This div container is where the React app will be mounted.

    </Aside>

6.  **Create Your React Application**:

    In the `src` directory, create an `index.js` file to serve as the entry point for your React application:

    ```js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import App from './App';
    import './styles.css';

    ReactDOM.render(
    	<React.StrictMode>
    		<App />
    	</React.StrictMode>,
    	document.getElementById('root'),
    );
    ```

7.  **Create the Main App Component**:

    Create an `App.js` file in the `src` directory and set up a basic MUI component:

    ```js
    import React from 'react';
    import { Button, Container, Typography } from '@mui/material';

    function App() {
    	return (
    		<Container>
    			<Typography variant="h2" component="h1" gutterBottom>
    				Welcome to MUI
    			</Typography>
    			<Button variant="contained" color="primary">
    				Hello World
    			</Button>
    		</Container>
    	);
    }

    export default App;
    ```

8.  **Add Basic Styling**:

    Create a `styles.css` file in the `src` directory to add some basic styling:

    ```css
    body {
    	margin: 0;
    	font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    }

    #root {
    	display: flex;
    	justify-content: center;
    	align-items: center;
    	height: 100vh;
    	background-color: #f5f5f5;
    }
    ```

9.  **Configure Babel**:

    If your project uses advanced JavaScript features or JSX, you might need to set up Babel. First, create a `.babelrc` file in the root directory:

    ```json
    {
    	"presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
    }
    ```

    Next, install Babel dependencies:

    ```shell
    pnpm add -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader
    ```

    <FileTree>

    -   my-mui-project/
        -   public/

        -   package.json
        -   pnpm-lock.yaml
        -   .babelrc
        -   **webpack.config.js**
    -   README.md

    </FileTree>

    ```js
    const path = require('path');
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

    module.exports = {
    	entry: './src/index.js',
    	output: {
    		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    		filename: 'bundle.js',
    	},
    	module: {
    		rules: [
    			{
    				test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
    				exclude: /node_modules/,
    				use: {
    					loader: 'babel-loader',
    				},
    			},
    			{
    				test: /\.css$/,
    				use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
    			},
    		],
    	},
    	plugins: [
    		new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    			template: './public/index.html',
    		}),
    	],
    	resolve: {
    		extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'],
    	},
    	devServer: {
    		contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    		compress: true,
    		port: 3000,
    	},
    };
    ```

    Install Webpack and its dependencies:

    ```shell
    pnpm add -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin style-loader css-loader
    ```

11. **Add Scripts to Package.json**:

    Add the following scripts to your `package.json` to build and start your application:

    ```json
    {
    	"scripts": {
    		"start": "webpack serve --mode development",
    		"build": "webpack --mode production"
    	}
    }
    ```

12. **Start Your Development Server**:

    Run the development server to see your MUI application in action:

    ```shell
    pnpm start
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see your MUI application running with a button and some text.

            - **esbuild.config.js**
        - README.md

    </FileTree>

3.  **Write Your JSX Component**:

    Create a simple React component in `src/components/Graph.jsx`:

    ```jsx
    // src/components/Graph.jsx
    import React from 'react';

    const Graph = () => {
    	return <div>This is a Graph component.</div>;
    };

    export default Graph;
    ```

    <FileTree>

        - my-project/
            - src/
                - components/
                    - **Graph.jsx**

                -   index.html
            - package.json
            - esbuild.config.js
        - README.md

    </FileTree>

4.  **Create an HTML File**;

    Create a simple HTML file in `public/index.html` to include your bundled script:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    	<head>
    		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
    		<meta
    			name="viewport"
    			content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    		<title>ESBuild Example</title>
    	</head>
    	<body>
    		<div id="root"></div>
    		<script src="graph.js"></script>
    	</body>
    </html>
    ```

    <FileTree>

        - my-project/
            - src/
                - components/
                    - Graph.jsx
            - public/
                - **index.html**
            - package.json
            - esbuild.config.js
        - README.md

    </FileTree>

5.  **Create an ESBuild Configuration File**:

    Create an `esbuild.config.js` file in the root of your project:

    ```js
    // esbuild.config.js
    const esbuild = require('esbuild');

    esbuild
    	.build({
    		entryPoints: ['src/components/Graph.jsx'],
    		bundle: true,
    		outfile: 'public/graph.js',
    		minify: true,
    		sourcemap: true,
    		platform: 'browser',
    		target: 'es2020',
    		jsxFactory: 'React.createElement',
    		jsxFragment: 'React.Fragment',
    	})
    	.catch(() => process.exit(1));
    ```

6.  **Add Build Script to package.json**:

    In your `package.json`, add a script to run the ESBuild configuration:

    ```json
    {
    	"name": "my-project",
    	"version": "1.0.0",
    	"scripts": {
    		"build": "node esbuild.config.js"
    	},
    	"devDependencies": {
    		"esbuild": "^0.13.0",
    		"react": "^17.0.0",
    		"react-dom": "^17.0.0"
    	}
    }
    ```

7.  **Build Your Project**:

    Run the build script from your terminal:

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will bundle your `Graph.jsx` component, minify the output, generate a source map, and output the final script to `public/graph.js`.

8.  **Serve Your HTML File**:

    You can use any static file server to serve your `public` directory. For simplicity, you can use the `serve` package:

    ```shell
    # Install the serve package globally
    npm install -g serve

    # Serve the public directory
    serve public
    ```

    Now, open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the `serve` command.
    You should see your HTML page with the bundled `Graph` component.

</Steps>

**ESBuild Example**

```shell

esbuild src/components/Graph.jsx --bundle --outfile=public/graph.js --minify --sourcemap --platform=browser --target=es2020 --jsx-factory=React.createElement --jsx-fragment=React.Fragment

```

This command tells esbuild to:

    *   Bundle the `Graph.jsx` file.
    *   Output the bundle to `public/graph.js`.
    *   Minify the output.
    *   Generate a source map.
    *   Set the platform to browser (handles browser globals like `window`).
    *   Target modern JavaScript (es2020).
    *   Properly handle JSX for React.

Explanation of Key Options:

-   **\--bundle**: Bundles all dependencies into one file.
-   **\--outfile**: Specifies the output file.
-   **\--minify**: Minimizes the output.
-   **\--sourcemap**: Generates a source map.
-   **\--platform**: Specifies the platform (node or browser).

## Signature Pad

[Signature Pad](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad) is a JavaScript library that utilizes HTML5 canvas technology to facilitate smooth signature drawing on web pages.
It's designed to function seamlessly across all modern desktop and mobile browsers without the need for any external libraries.
Signature Pad supports various features like variable width Bézier curve interpolation, allowing for natural pen strokes and is ideal for applications requiring users to provide signatures digitally.
You can install it via npm or directly embed it into your web pages using a script tag.
For developers looking to implement detailed canvas-based interactions, Signature Pad offers extensive API options for managing signature data.

**Singature Pad Tutorial**

<Steps>

1.  **Install and Include Signature Pad**:

    You can install Signature Pad using npm or yarn, or directly include it in your HTML file. If you are using npm or yarn, run one of the following commands in your project directory:

    ```shell
    npm install signature_pad
    ```

    Alternatively, you can directly include Signature Pad in your HTML page using a script tag.
    This method is particularly useful if you're not using a JavaScript module bundler:

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/signature_pad@latest/dist/signature_pad.umd.min.js"></script>
    ```

    This script tag links to the latest version of Signature Pad hosted on the jsDelivr CDN, making it immediately available for use in your project.

2.  **Create a Canvas Element**:

    Add a canvas element to your HTML where the signature will be drawn:

    ```html
    <canvas id="signature-pad" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
    ```

3.  **Initialize Signature Pad**:

    In your JavaScript file, initialize Signature Pad on the canvas element:

    ```js
    const canvas = document.getElementById('signature-pad');
    const signaturePad = new SignaturePad(canvas);
    ```

4.  **Configure Options (Optional)**:

    Configure Signature Pad with options such as pen color or background color:

    ```js
    const options = {
    	backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 255, 255)', // Set canvas background color
    	penColor: 'rgb(0, 0, 0)', // Set pen color
    };
    const signaturePad = new SignaturePad(canvas, options);
    ```

5.  **Handling Resize**:

    Add event listeners to resize the canvas appropriately when the window size changes:

    ```js
    function resizeCanvas() {
    	const ratio = Math.max(window.devicePixelRatio || 1, 1);
    	canvas.width = canvas.offsetWidth * ratio;
    	canvas.height = canvas.offsetHeight * ratio;
    	canvas.getContext('2d').scale(ratio, ratio);
    	signaturePad.clear(); // otherwise isEmpty might return incorrect value
    }

    window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas);
    resizeCanvas();
    ```

6.  **Save and Clear Functions**:

    Implement functions to save the signature to an image or clear the canvas:

    ```js
    document.getElementById('save').addEventListener('click', function () {
    	const dataURL = signaturePad.toDataURL();
    	console.log(dataURL); // Save the data URL of the signature image
    });

    document.getElementById('clear').addEventListener('click', function () {
    	signaturePad.clear();
    });
    ```

</Steps>

### Cypress

Cypress stands out as a comprehensive testing framework specifically tailored for modern web applications and written in JavaScript.
Developers favor Cypress for its ability to streamline the testing process, enabling the creation of end-to-end tests, integration tests, and unit tests in a manner that is both coherent and straightforward. Unlike other testing tools, Cypress operates directly within the browser and executes commands concurrently with the application's run loop. Such synchronization facilitates real-time interaction and debugging while its automatic waiting feature minimizes the inconsistencies commonly associated with asynchronous test execution.
The framework's extensive API library and user-friendly dashboard further bolster test automation and monitoring.
These features collectively make Cypress a highly regarded tool among developers aiming to enhance the robustness and reliability of web applications.

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip: Cypress">

When writing tests with Cypress, it’s beneficial to use the **.contains()** command to select elements by their text content.
This approach is more resilient to changes in the UI, such as class names or IDs, making your tests less likely to break with UI updates.
Additionally, consider using Cypress’s network stubbing capabilities with **cy.route()** or **cy.intercept()** to control and test network responses without relying on external servers.
This ensures your tests run quickly and remain consistent, regardless of network conditions.

#### Cypress Tutorial

<Steps>

1.  Install Cypress in your project:

    ```shell
    npm install cypress --save-dev
    ```

    This command adds Cypress to your project as a development dependency, ensuring that it's available for writing and running tests.

2.  Open Cypress for the first time:

    ```shell
    npx cypress open
    ```

    Running this command sets up the initial Cypress configuration and opens the Cypress Test Runner, which helps you manage and run your tests.

3.  Create the test files:

    After opening Cypress, it automatically generates a `cypress` folder in your project.
    Inside this folder, create two files: `app.cy.ts` for your test cases and `app.po.ts` for your page objects, which help manage element selectors and interactions in a reusable manner.

    `app.po.ts` File:

    ```ts
    // app.po.ts
    export class PageObjects {
    	getSubmitButton() {
    		return cy.get('button[type="submit"]');
    	}
    }
    ```

    `app.cy.ts` File:

    ```ts
    // app.cy.ts
    import { PageObjects } from './app.po';

    describe('App Test', () => {
    	const page = new PageObjects();

    	beforeEach(() => {
    		cy.visit('http://localhost:3000'); // Adjust URL to your application's URL
    	});

    	it('Should click the submit button', () => {
    		page.getSubmitButton().click();
    		cy.url().should('include', '/success'); // Adjust the assertion to match expected behavior
    	});
    });
    ```

4.  Run your tests:

    ```shell
    npx cypress run
    ```

    The command runs your tests in the headless mode, which is suitable for continuous integration environments or local test runs without the GUI.

5.  Review test results:

    After running the tests, Cypress provides detailed results in the terminal or command prompt.
    If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use npx cypress open to run tests and observe their execution in real time.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Warning: Cypress Usage">

When using Cypress for testing, ensure that your test environment closely mimics your production environment to avoid discrepancies that could affect test reliability.
Avoid using production credentials or sensitive data in your test scripts to maintain security.
Be mindful of Cypress's limitation with cross-origin policies when designing tests that interact with multiple domains.

</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Danger: Security Risks with Cypress">

Be vigilant about not hardcoding sensitive information such as passwords or API keys directly in your Cypress tests.
Exposing sensitive data can lead to security breaches and data leaks.
Always use environment variables to manage sensitive information securely, and ensure that these variables are not included in version control.
Additionally, regularly review your test scripts and environment configurations to prevent accidental exposure of secure data.

</Aside>

**Cypress JSON API Example**

Example Function:

```ts
export const checkJSONendpointAPI = (endpoints: string[]) => {
	endpoints.forEach((endpoint) => {
		cy.request(endpoint).then((response) => {
			expect(response.status).to.eq(200);
			expect(response.headers['content-type']).to.include(
				'application/json',
			);
			expect(response.body).to.be.an('object');
		});
	});
};
```

<Steps>

1.  **Define the Function and Parameters**:
    Begin by declaring the function `checkJSONendpointAPI` and specify that it accepts an array of strings, where each string represents an API endpoint URL.

    ```ts
    export const checkJSONendpointAPI = (endpoints: string[]) => {};
    ```

    This setup allows the function to handle multiple endpoints, making it versatile for API testing.

2.  **Iterate Over the Endpoints**:
    Use the `forEach` method to loop through each endpoint provided in the array.
    This method applies a function to each item in the array, which in this case is used to initiate a Cypress request to the endpoint.

    ```ts
    endpoints.forEach((endpoint) => {});
    ```

    This step is crucial for automating the process of sending requests to multiple endpoints without repeating code.

3.  **Make a Request to Each Endpoint**:

    Within the loop, use `cy.request()` to send an HTTP request to the current endpoint.
    This Cypress command is designed to handle asynchronous requests and fetches data from the specified endpoint.

    ```ts
    cy.request(endpoint).then((response) => {});
    ```

    Here, `cy.request` returns a promise that resolves with the response object, allowing you to inspect the response further in the subsequent steps.

4.  **Check the Response Status**:
    After receiving the response, ensure that the HTTP status code is `200`. This status code indicates that the request was successful.

    ```ts
    expect(response.status).to.eq(200);
    ```

    Checking the status code is a basic validation to confirm that the endpoint is reachable and responding as expected.

5.  **Validate the Content-Type**:
    Verify that the `Content-Type` header of the response includes `application/json`.
    This step confirms that the endpoint is indeed returning JSON data.

    ```ts
    expect(response.headers['content-type']).to.include('application/json');
    ```

    It's essential to check the `Content-Type` to ensure that the data format is correct, as the subsequent validation assumes JSON format.

6.  **Assess the Response Body**:
    Finally, ensure that the response body is an object.
    This check is vital because JSON data, when parsed, should typically be an object or an array.
    ```ts
    expect(response.body).to.be.an('object');
    ```
    The assertion verifies that the parsed JSON data structure is as expected, reinforcing the integrity of the response.
7.  Close out the function and then check if it executes without any issues!

</Steps>

## Expo

Expo is a powerful open-source platform that supercharges React Native development, letting developers craft universal apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript, all while streamlining workflows and minimizing native code hassles.
With the release of Expo SDK 52, it embraces React Native 0.76 and introduces the New Architecture by default for new projects, boosting performance by replacing the old bridge with a faster, more efficient system—think of it as upgrading from a rickety rope bridge to a sleek steel highway.
This SDK brings stable goodies like the `expo-video` library, offering slick video playback with lock screen controls and Picture-in-Picture support, alongside beta features like `expo-audio` and enhanced file management with expo-file-system.
It’s a playground for developers, with tools like Expo Router v4 for seamless navigation, experimental tree shaking to trim unused code, and even a taste of React Server Components for cutting-edge app-building.
Expo SDK 52 also ditches JSC for the speedier Hermes engine and ups minimum OS requirements (iOS 15.1, Android 24), ensuring modern compatibility.
From rapid prototyping to polished production apps, Expo transforms complex mobile development into an engaging, accessible adventure—one line of code at a time.

<Aside type="note" title="Expo SDK 52">

These notes are for Expo SDK 52 with some minor references to the beta SDK 53!

</Aside>

### Expo Webpack

This section is for the `Expo` webpack.

The Expo Webpack, once a cornerstone of Expo’s web development ecosystem, was a tailored configuration built on Webpack 4 to bundle React Native apps for the browser, enabling single-page applications (SPAs) with a setup inspired by Create React App.
Integrated through `@expo/webpack-config`, it streamlined the process of transpiling JavaScript, optimizing assets, and managing dependencies, allowing developers to target web platforms alongside [iOS](/application/xcode/) and [Android](/application/android/) with minimal friction—think of it as a trusty Swiss Army knife for cross-platform bundling.
Webpack leveraged tools like Babel for broad compatibility and supported progressive web app (PWA) features via Workbox, making offline functionality a breeze.
However, as of SDK 50 in late 2023, Expo Webpack has been deprecated in favor of Metro, Expo’s newer universal bundler, which promises tighter alignment with React Native’s native ecosystem and faster performance. While customizable through expo customize:web, its maintenance mode status—announced in early 2024—signals a shift, leaving developers with a robust but aging tool that’s being sunsetted for a more cohesive future.
Still, for legacy projects or specific use cases, it remains a battle-tested option, packing a punch of efficiency and familiarity.

<Aside type="caution" title="Looking to modernize your Expo web setup?">

Switch to Metro, Expo’s current universal bundler, and pair it with a static build for a leaner, faster workflow.
With Metro’s tighter integration into the React Native ecosystem and support in SDK 50+, you’ll get quicker builds and seamless multi-platform alignment—perfect for ditching Webpack’s legacy baggage while keeping your app snappy and future-proof.

</Aside>

In the event that you encounter this error: `Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached` , update the `webpack.config.js` with an ignore on `node_modules` folder.

```js

config.watchOptions = {
		...config.watchOptions,
		ignored: ['**/node_modules/**'], // Ignore all files in node_modules
	};

```

### Expo Metro

Expo Metro is the beating heart of React Native bundling, a blazing-fast JavaScript bundler forged by Meta to power apps like Facebook and Instagram, now supercharged for the Expo ecosystem.
Born in 2017 as an open-source spin-off from React Native’s packager, Metro transforms your sprawling code—JavaScript, TypeScript, even CSS on web—into a single, efficient bundle, ready to run on iOS, Android, or browsers with Hermes or Chakra engines.
With Expo SDK 52 (November 2024), it’s turbocharged by the New Architecture, slashing [resolution](https://metrobundler.dev/docs/resolution/#resolve) times up to 15x via a rewritten resolver—think of it as a librarian who instantly knows every book’s shelf.
It’s not just speed; Metro’s async route splitting, introduced in SDK 50, loads only what’s needed, making apps feel snappy—like a chef prepping just your order, not the whole menu. Maintained by Meta’s engineers, it scales effortlessly, handling over 400,000 source files with tricks like Watchman file-watching and lazy SHA-1 hashing (metro@0.81.2), cutting memory use for tools like Replit.
Expo CLI leans hard into Metro, ditching Webpack in SDK 50 for a unified, cross-platform beast that supports DOM components—imagine web libraries popping into native apps via webviews. It’s customizable too; tweak metro.config.js to hoist assets like SQLite databases or redirect imports, all while caching aggressively to avoid Babel’s grind on every reload.
Metro’s web game is strong—CSS module nesting and static builds mean SEO-friendly sites, while eager builds (`npx expo run --eager`) pre-bundle for native speed-ups.
Sure, it’s not perfect—dynamic imports need hacks like `@metro-ignore`, and monorepo fans rejoice at pnpm support—but it’s battle-tested across millions of devices.
Expo Metro isn’t just a bundler; it’s a time machine, hurling your app into the future, one optimized byte at a time.

<Aside type="tip" title="Nx Metro Configuration">

Below is an example of a `metro.config.js` that we use in our Nx Monorepo.

</Aside>

```js

// Import the Nx-specific Metro integration from '@nx/expo'
// This helper enhances Metro for Nx monorepos, managing workspace dependencies and watch folders
const { withNxMetro } = require('@nx/expo');

// Import Expo’s default Metro configuration generator
// This provides a baseline Metro config tailored for Expo projects, rooted at the project directory
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('@expo/metro-config');

// Import NativeWind’s Metro plugin for Tailwind CSS integration
// This wires up CSS-in-JS styling (like Tailwind) for React Native components
const { withNativeWind } = require('nativewind/metro');

// Import Metro’s config merger utility
// This allows combining multiple config objects into one, resolving overlaps cleanly
const { mergeConfig } = require('metro-config');

// Fetch the default Expo Metro config, passing __dirname as the project root
// __dirname ensures the config knows where to look for files relative to this script
const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// Destructure assetExts and sourceExts from the default config’s resolver
// assetExts lists file types Metro treats as assets (e.g., png, jpg); sourceExts lists code files (e.g., js, ts)
const { assetExts, sourceExts } = defaultConfig.resolver;

/**

<Steps>

0.  Key Explanations for the Metro Configuration.
1.  Imports: 
    -   Each library integrates a specific feature—Nx for monorepos, Expo for defaults, NativeWind for Tailwind, and Metro for merging.
2.  Default Config: 
    -   getDefaultConfig(__dirname) sets up a standard Expo-aware Metro config, which we extend.
3.  Custom Config:
    -   Tweaks caching, SVG handling (via a transformer), and file extensions for broader compatibility.
4.  SVG Handling:
    -   Removing svg from assetExts and adding it to sourceExts ensures SVGs are processed as code, not assets.
5.  Async Flow:
    -   createConfig chains withNxMetro and withNativeWind asynchronously, building the config step-by-step.
6.  NxMetro:
    -   Enhances Metro for Nx workspaces, though here it’s minimal (no extra watchFolders).
7.  NativeWind:
    -   Adds Tailwind CSS, linking to global.css for styling.
