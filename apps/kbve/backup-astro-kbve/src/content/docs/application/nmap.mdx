## Information

-   Nmap / "Network Mapper" is an open source utility for scanning and analyzing networks within the environment; the application's primary function is for security probing and audits.

<Adsense />

## Cheatsheet

-   You can replace all instances of `{$ip_address}` or `127.0.0.1` with the IP address that you want to scan.
-   The total ports that will be scanned are from the range of `0` to `65535`.
-   Port `0` is not a specific binding port but rather a wild card port that tells the unix system to find and allocate the next available port.

-   Scan UDP / TCP and all ports.

    -   ```shell
        sudo nmap -sU -sT -p0-65535 {$ip_address}
        ```
