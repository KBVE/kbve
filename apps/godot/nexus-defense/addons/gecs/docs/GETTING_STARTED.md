# Getting Started with GECS

> **Build your first ECS project in 5 minutes**

This guide will walk you through creating a simple player entity with health and transform components using GECS. By the end, you'll understand the core concepts and have a working example.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Godot 4.x installed
- Basic GDScript knowledge
- 5 minutes of your time

## ⚡ Step 1: Setup (1 minute)

### Install GECS

1. **Download GECS** and place it in your project's `addons/` folder
2. **Enable the plugin**: Go to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins` and enable "GECS"
3. **Verify setup**: The ECS singleton should be automatically added to AutoLoad

> 💡 **Quick Check**: If you see errors, make sure `ECS` appears in `Project > Project Settings > AutoLoad`

## 🎮 Step 2: Your First Entity (2 minutes)

Entities in GECS extend Godot's `Node` class. You have two options for creating entities:

### **Option A: Scene-based Entities** (For spatial properties)

Use this when you need access to `Node3D` or `Node2D` properties like position, rotation, scale, or want to add visual children (sprites, meshes, etc.).

> ⚠️ **Key Point**: `Entity` extends `Node` (not `Node3D` or `Node2D`), so create a scene with the appropriate spatial node type as the root, then attach your entity script to it.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a new scene** in Godot:
    - Click `Scene > New Scene` or press `Ctrl+N`
    - Select **"Node3D"** as the root node type (for 3D games) or **"Node2D"** (for 2D games)
    - Rename the root node to `Player`

2. **Attach the entity script**:
    - With the root node selected, click the "Attach Script" button (📄+ icon)
    - Save as `e_player.gd`

3. **Save the scene**:
    - Save as `e_player.tscn` in your scenes folder

**File: `e_player.gd`**

```gdscript
# e_player.gd
class_name Player
extends Entity

func on_ready():
    # Sync the entity's scene position to the Transform component
    if has_component(C_Transform):
        var c_trs = get_component(C_Transform) as C_Transform
        c_trs.position = self.global_position
```

> 💡 **Use case**: Players, enemies, projectiles, or anything that needs a position in your game world.

### **Option B: Code-based Entities** (Pure data containers)

Use this when you DON'T need spatial properties and just want a pure data container (e.g., game managers, abstract systems, timers).

```gdscript
# Just extend Entity directly
class_name GameManager
extends Entity

# No scene needed - instantiate with GameManager.new()
```

> 💡 **Use case**: Game state managers, quest trackers, inventory systems, or any non-spatial game logic.

---

**For this tutorial**, we'll use **Option A** (scene-based) since we want our player to move around the screen with a position.

## 📦 Step 3: Your First Components (1 minute)

Components hold data. Let's create health and transform components:

**File: `c_health.gd`**

```gdscript
# c_health.gd
class_name C_Health
extends Component

@export var current: float = 100.0
@export var maximum: float = 100.0

func _init(max_health: float = 100.0):
    maximum = max_health
    current = max_health
```

**File: `c_transform.gd`**

```gdscript
# c_transform.gd
class_name C_Transform
extends Component

@export var position: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO

func _init(pos: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO):
    position = pos
```

**File: `c_velocity.gd`**

```gdscript
# c_velocity.gd
class_name C_Velocity
extends Component

@export var velocity: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO

func _init(vel: Vector3 = Vector3.ZERO):
    velocity = vel
```

> 💡 **Key Principle**: Components only hold data, never logic. Think of them as data containers.
> ⚠️ **Important Note**: Components `_init` function requires that all arguments have a default value or Godot will crash.

## ⚙️ Step 4: Your First System (1 minute)

Systems contain the logic that operates on entities with specific components. This system moves entities across the screen:

**File: `s_movement.gd`**

```gdscript
# s_movement.gd
class_name MovementSystem
extends System

func query():
    # Find all entities that have both transform and velocity
    return q.with_all([C_Transform, C_Velocity])

func process(entities: Array[Entity], components: Array, delta: float):
    # Process each entity in the array
    for entity in entities:
        var c_trs = entity.get_component(C_Transform) as C_Transform
        var c_velocity = entity.get_component(C_Velocity) as C_Velocity

        # Move the entity based on its velocity
        c_trs.position += c_velocity.velocity * delta

        # Update the actual entity position in the scene
        entity.global_position = c_trs.position

        # Bounce off screen edges (simple example)
        if c_trs.position.x > 10 or c_trs.position.x < -10:
            c_velocity.velocity.x *= -1
```

> 💡 **System Logic**: Query finds entities with required components, process() runs the movement logic on each entity every frame.

## 🎬 Step 5: See It Work (1 minute)

Now let's put it all together in a main scene:

### Create Main Scene

1. **Create a new scene** with a `Node` as the root
2. **Add a World node** as a child (Add Child Node > search for "World")
3. **Attach this script** to the root node:

**File: `main.gd`**

```gdscript
# main.gd
extends Node

@onready var world: World = $World

func _ready():
    ECS.world = world

    # Load and instantiate the player entity scene
    var player_scene = preload("res://e_player.tscn")  # Adjust path as needed
    var e_player = player_scene.instantiate() as Player

    # Add components to the entity
    e_player.add_components([
        C_Health.new(100),
        C_Transform.new(),
        C_Velocity.new(Vector3(2, 0, 0))  # Move right at 2 units/second
    ])

    add_child(e_player)  # Add to scene tree
    ECS.world.add_entity(e_player)  # Add to ECS world

    # Create the movement system
    var movement_system = MovementSystem.new()
    ECS.world.add_system(movement_system)

func _process(delta):
    # Process all systems
    if ECS.world:
        ECS.process(delta)
```

**Run your project!** 🎉 You now have a working ECS setup where the player entity moves across the screen and bounces off the edges! The MovementSystem updates entity positions based on their velocity components.

> 💡 **Scene-based entities**: Notice we load and instantiate the `e_player.tscn` scene instead of calling `Player.new()`. This is required because we need access to spatial properties (position). For entities that don't need spatial properties, `Entity.new()` works fine.

## 🎯 What You Just Built

Congratulations! You've created your first ECS project with:

- **Entity**: Player - a container for components
- **Components**: C_Health, C_Transform, C_Velocity - pure data containers
- **System**: MovementSystem - logic that moves entities based on velocity
- **World**: Container that manages entities and systems

## 📈 Next Steps

Now that you have the basics working, here's how to level up:

### 1. Create Entity Prefabs (Recommended)

Instead of creating entities in code, use Godot's scene system:

1. **Create a new scene** with your Entity class as the root node
2. **Add visual children** (MeshInstance3D, Sprite3D, etc.)
3. **Add components via define_components()** or `component_resources` array in Inspector
4. **Save as .tscn file** (e.g., `e_player.tscn`)
5. **Load and instantiate** in your main scene

```gdscript
# Improved e_player.gd with define_components()
class_name Player
extends Entity

func define_components() -> Array:
    return [
        C_Health.new(100),
        C_Transform.new(),
        C_Velocity.new(Vector3(1, 0, 0))  # Move right slowly
    ]

func on_ready():
    # Sync scene position to component
    if has_component(C_Transform):
        var c_trs = get_component(C_Transform) as C_Transform
        c_trs.position = self.global_position
```

### 2. Organize Your Main Scene

Structure your main scene using the proven scene-based pattern:

```
Main.tscn
├── World (World node)
├── DefaultSystems (instantiated from default_systems.tscn)
│   ├── input (SystemGroup)
│   ├── gameplay (SystemGroup)
│   ├── physics (SystemGroup)
│   └── ui (SystemGroup)
├── Level (Node3D for static environment)
└── Entities (Node3D for spawned entities)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Visual organization** in Godot editor
- **Easy system reordering** between groups
- **Reusable system configurations**

## ❓ Having Issues?

### Player not responding?

- Check that `ECS.process(delta)` is called in `_process()`
- Verify components are added to the entity via `define_components()` or Inspector
- Make sure the system is added to the world
- Ensure transform synchronization is called in entity's `on_ready()`

### Can't access position/rotation properties?

- ⚠️ **Entity extends Node, not Node3D**: To access spatial properties, create a scene with `Node3D` (3D) or `Node2D` (2D) as the root node type
- Attach your entity script (that extends `Entity`) to the Node3D/Node2D root
- Load and instantiate the scene file (don't use `.new()` for spatial entities)
- **If you don't need spatial properties**: Using `Entity.new()` is perfectly fine for pure data containers
- See Step 2 for both entity creation approaches

### Errors in console?

- Check that all classes extend the correct base class
- Verify file names match class names
- Ensure GECS plugin is enabled
