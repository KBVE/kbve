## What is KBVE?

KBVE is a collective that builds different programs, libraries, games and memes!
This monorepo is the heart of all our applications, making it easier to manage while providing an experimental playground for pipelines.
The core of this Monorepo is based upon [Nx Smart Monorepos](https://nx.dev/), but do not fear! This is easy once you get the hang of it!

Examples of monorepos:

- [Cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com)
- [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b/)

Perks of a monorepo include:

- Consistent Developer Environment and Experience.

    - A monorepo can provide a consistent environment and set of tools for all developers, which can be especially beneficial in large organizations with many projects.
    - Easier AI Training, as the codebase is all within a controlled repo.

- Less clutter, keeping a single source of truth.

    - The monorepo acts as a centralized source of truth for all projects, configurations, and dependencies.

- Atomic Changes.

    - Developers can make cross-cutting changes across multiple projects within a single atomic commit.

- Scalable.
    - Modern monorepo build tools and practices are designed to scale, even as the number of projects and developers grows.
